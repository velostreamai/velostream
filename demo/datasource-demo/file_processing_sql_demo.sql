   - Or run: velo-sql --file ./demo/datasource-demo/file_processing_sql_demo.sql

4. Output:
   - CREATE STREAM statements define processing pipelines
   - Data flows through multiple transformation stages
   - UNION ALL combines different calculation approaches

4. Expected Performance:
   - Exact financial precision with ScaledInteger arithmetic
   - No rounding errors in calculations
   - Real-time processing with sub-second latency
   - Compressed output with file rotation

Key Features Demonstrated:
✅ Streaming SQL with CREATE STREAM
✅ Exact financial precision with ScaledInteger arithmetic
✅ Real-time windowed aggregations (tumbling, session windows)
✅ Complex analytics queries with exact decimal calculations
✅ Fraud detection and alerting patterns
✅ Performance monitoring and data quality tracking
✅ Multiple transformation pipelines with UNION
