## 🎯 **PRIORITY 2: Cluster Operations & Visibility** 🔍 **FR-061 FOUNDATION**
**Status**: 🔴 **MISSING** - Essential foundation for Kubernetes-native distributed processing
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks | **Impact**: CRITICAL (Enables FR-061 distributed processing)
**Source**: FR-061 Kubernetes-Native Distributed Processing prerequisites

### **📋 Critical Missing Commands**

  - [ ] `SHOW JOBS ON NODE 'node-id'` - Jobs on specific node
  - [ ] `SHOW JOB STATUS 'job-name'` - Detailed job information
  - [ ] Include node deployment info (which node, resource usage)

- [ ] **LIST STREAMS** - Discover available data streams
  - [ ] `SHOW STREAMS` - List all registered Kafka topics/streams
  - [ ] `SHOW STREAMS LIKE 'pattern'` - Pattern matching
  - [ ] Include topic partitions, replication factor, consumer lag

- [ ] **LIST TABLES** - Show materialized views and KTables
  - [ ] `SHOW TABLES` - List all registered tables
  - [ ] `SHOW TABLES WITH SCHEMAS` - Include column information
  - [ ] Show backing storage and partitioning

- [ ] **LIST TOPICS** - Raw Kafka topic discovery
  - [ ] `SHOW TOPICS` - All available Kafka topics
  - [ ] `SHOW TOPIC DETAILS 'topic-name'` - Partitions, replicas, config

### **🎯 Success Criteria (FR-061 Phase 1 Prerequisites)**
- ✅ `SHOW JOBS` works across multi-node cluster → **Enables Kubernetes workload visibility**
- ✅ Can identify which node is running which job → **Required for HPA pod orchestration**
- ✅ Stream/topic discovery works from any node → **Supports SQL hint system integration**
- ✅ Job deployment considers node capacity → **Foundation for workload-specific scaling**
- ✅ Cluster survives node failures gracefully → **Required for 99.9% availability SLA**

### **📊 Current State Analysis**
**✅ Foundation Exists**:
- StreamJobServer has `list_jobs()` method (single node)
- ShowProcessor supports SHOW STREAMS/TABLES/TOPICS (basic)
- Job metrics and status tracking implemented

**❌ Missing Critical Pieces**:
- No cluster-wide job visibility
