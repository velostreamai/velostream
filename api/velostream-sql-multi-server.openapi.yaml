  description: |
    Performance monitoring and job management API for Velostream Multi-Job SQL Server.
    
    The Multi-Job SQL Server enables concurrent execution of multiple SQL applications
    against Kafka streams, with comprehensive performance monitoring and job lifecycle
    management capabilities.
    
    ## Getting Started
    
    Start the server with monitoring enabled:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin velo-sql server --enable-metrics --max-jobs 10
    ```
    
    Deploy a SQL application:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin velo-sql deploy-app --file trading-analytics.sql --brokers localhost:9092
    ```
    
    ## Features
    - Concurrent multi-job SQL processing
    - Per-job performance metrics and monitoring
    - Job lifecycle management (start, stop, pause, resume)
    - Aggregate performance metrics across all jobs
    - Real-time job status and resource utilization
