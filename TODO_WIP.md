# 📋 **NUMBERED DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES**

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE 1: PERFORMANCE TEST CONSOLIDATION** ⚡ **COMPLETED**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - GitHub Actions optimized, test infrastructure production-ready
**Timeline**: 3 weeks total consolidation completed
**Impact**: **HIGH** - 30% code reduction, optimized CI/CD, complete performance coverage

### 🚨 **CRITICAL PROBLEM**
- **10 performance test files, 5,112 lines total** - Massive code duplication (~30%)
- **Duplicate SQL benchmarks** - Same tests across multiple files with different approaches
- **Inconsistent measurement frameworks** - Each file implements its own timing/metrics logic
- **Performance coverage gaps** - Missing end-to-end integration, memory profiling, scalability tests
- **Poor test organization** - Related tests scattered across different files, hard to maintain

### 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**
- **30% code reduction**: From 5,112 lines to ~4,000 lines through deduplication
- **Zero duplicate tests**: Single implementation for each performance scenario
- **Unified measurement framework**: Consistent timing/metrics across all tests
