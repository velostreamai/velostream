# Feature Request: SQL Support for FerrisStreams

## Summary

Add comprehensive SQL query capabilities to ferrisstreams, enabling developers to process Kafka streams using familiar SQL syntax instead of, or in combination with, programmatic stream processing. This feature would bridge the gap between SQL-familiar data engineers and Rust-based stream processing, making ferrisstreams accessible to a broader audience while maintaining its performance and type-safety advantages.

## Motivation

### Current Limitations
- **Barrier to Entry**: Developers familiar with SQL but not Rust cannot easily adopt ferrisstreams
- **Complex Stream Operations**: Implementing complex aggregations, joins, and windowing requires significant Rust coding
- **No Ad-hoc Queries**: Cannot perform exploratory data analysis or one-off queries against Kafka streams
- **Limited Analytics**: Current KTable implementation lacks advanced analytical capabilities

### Benefits of SQL Support
- **Lower Learning Curve**: SQL-familiar developers can immediately start processing Kafka streams
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick exploration and validation of stream processing logic
- **Standardization**: SQL provides a well-understood interface for stream processing operations
- **Complementary Approach**: SQL for rapid development, Rust for performance-critical operations

## Proposed Solution

### Three-Tier Architecture Approach

#### Tier 1: SQL Query Interface (ferris-sql)
```rust
use ferrisstreams::sql::*;

// Create SQL context with Kafka streams
let sql_context = SqlContext::new()
    .register_stream("orders", orders_consumer)
    .register_table("users", users_ktable);

// Execute streaming SQL queries
let result_stream = sql_context.execute("
    SELECT 
        o.order_id,
        u.user_name,
        o.amount,
        COUNT(*) OVER (
            PARTITION BY o.user_id 
            ORDER BY o.timestamp 
            RANGE INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING
        ) as orders_last_hour
    FROM orders o
    JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE o.amount > 100
").await?;
```

#### Tier 2: Query Execution Engine
- **DataFusion Integration**: Leverage Apache DataFusion for SQL parsing and optimization
- **Streaming Adapter**: Custom execution layer to bridge DataFusion with ferrisstreams
- **Type Integration**: Seamless integration with ferrisstreams' serialization system

#### Tier 3: Stream Processing Runtime
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Built on top of current KafkaConsumer, KTable, and Message types
- **Performance**: Maintains Rust's performance characteristics
- **Compatibility**: Full compatibility with existing ferrisstreams applications

## Streaming-Native SQL Architecture

### Custom Streaming SQL Engine

**Approach**: Build a purpose-built SQL parser and execution engine designed specifically for streaming semantics from the ground up.

**Key Features**:
- **True Streaming**: Native support for streaming operations like windowing, watermarks, and event-time processing
- **Kafka-Optimized**: Direct integration with ferrisstreams' Message, Headers, and KTable abstractions
- **Zero Overhead**: No impedance mismatch between batch-oriented SQL and streaming reality
- **Streaming SQL Extensions**: Custom operators for Kafka-specific patterns (compaction, log semantics)
- **Full Control**: Complete control over execution model, memory management, and performance characteristics
- **Type Integration**: Deep integration with Rust's type system and ferrisstreams serialization

**Design Principles**:
- **Event-at-a-Time Processing**: Process individual events as they arrive
- **Bounded Memory Usage**: Automatic state management with configurable memory limits
- **Streaming Semantics First**: Event time, watermarks, and late data handling built-in
- **Rust Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and compile-time optimizations

    FROM clicks c
    JOIN purchases p ON c.user_id = p.user_id
    WHERE p.event_time BETWEEN c.event_time AND c.event_time + INTERVAL '1' HOUR
").await?;

// Complex event processing patterns
pub struct StreamJoinOperator {
    left_buffer: TimeWindowBuffer,

});

// Pattern matching for complex events
sql_context.execute_streaming("
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY event_time
        MEASURES 
            FIRST(amount) as first_amount,
            LAST(amount) as last_amount
        PATTERN (SMALL_ORDER+ LARGE_ORDER)
        DEFINE 
            SMALL_ORDER AS amount < 50,
            LARGE_ORDER AS amount > 500
    )
").await?;

// Streaming materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_metrics AS
SELECT 
    user_id,

    .max_memory_mb(1024)
    .enable_metrics(true)
    .checkpoint_interval(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .backpressure_strategy(BackpressureStrategy::DropOldest)
    .watermark_delay(Duration::from_secs(5));

## Technical Considerations

### Streaming Semantics
- **Event Time vs Processing Time**: Native support for both timing models with explicit time column declarations
- **Watermarks**: Configurable watermark generation based on event timestamps with late data handling
- **Bounded State**: Automatic state expiration for windowed operations to prevent memory leaks
- **Exactly-Once Processing**: Integration with Kafka's transactional semantics for consistency

### Type System Integration
```rust
// Deep integration with ferrisstreams serialization
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, StreamingSchema)]
struct Order {
    #[streaming(primary_key)]
    order_id: String,
    user_id: String,
    amount: f64,
    #[streaming(event_time)]
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

// Automatic schema registration
impl StreamingSchema for Order {
    fn streaming_schema() -> Schema {
        Schema::new()
            .add_field("order_id", DataType::String, false)
            .add_field("user_id", DataType::String, false)
            .add_field("amount", DataType::Float64, false)
            .add_field("created_at", DataType::Timestamp, false)
            .set_event_time_column("created_at")
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations  
- **Zero-Copy Streaming**: Direct processing on ferrisstreams Message types without serialization overhead
- **Incremental Processing**: Stream-oriented execution model processing one event at a time
- **Memory-Bounded Windows**: Configurable memory limits for windowed aggregations with LRU eviction
- **SIMD Optimizations**: Vectorized operations for aggregate computations where possible

## Scaling Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

#### 1. Query Partitioning and Distribution
```rust
// Distributed query execution across multiple nodes
pub struct DistributedSqlContext {
    local_context: StreamingSqlContext,
    coordinator: QueryCoordinator,
    partition_strategy: PartitionStrategy,
}

// Automatic query partitioning based on GROUP BY keys
impl DistributedSqlContext {
    pub async fn execute_distributed(&self, query: &str) -> Result<DistributedStream, SqlError> {
        let plan = self.analyze_and_partition(query)?;
        
        match plan.partition_type {
            PartitionType::ByKey(keys) => {
                // Distribute based on grouping keys
                self.execute_key_partitioned(plan, keys).await
            }
            PartitionType::Temporal(window) => {
                // Distribute based on time windows
                self.execute_time_partitioned(plan, window).await
            }
            PartitionType::Broadcast => {
                // Replicate to all nodes for joins
                self.execute_broadcast(plan).await
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Kafka-Native Partitioning Integration
```rust
// Leverage Kafka's natural partitioning for SQL scalability
pub struct KafkaPartitionedExecution {
    partition_assignments: HashMap<i32, NodeId>,
    rebalance_coordinator: RebalanceCoordinator,
}

// Automatic scaling based on Kafka partition assignment
sql_context.configure_partitioning(PartitioningConfig {
    // Each SQL query instance processes assigned Kafka partitions
    partition_assignment_strategy: PartitionAssignmentStrategy::RangeAssignor,
    
    // Automatic rebalancing when nodes join/leave
    enable_rebalancing: true,
    
    // State migration during rebalancing
    state_migration_strategy: StateMigrationStrategy::Checkpointed,
})?;
```

#### 3. Multi-Level Aggregation for Scale
```rust
// Hierarchical aggregation to handle high-cardinality GROUP BY
sql_context.execute_distributed("
    SELECT 
        region,
        user_segment,
        COUNT(*) as total_users,
        SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
    FROM user_events
    GROUP BY region, user_segment
    
    -- Automatic pre-aggregation at partition level
    WITH LOCAL_AGGREGATION (
        PARTITION_SIZE = 100000,
        FLUSH_INTERVAL = '30 seconds'
    )
").await?;

// Two-phase aggregation implementation
pub struct HierarchicalAggregator {
    // Local aggregation within each partition
    local_aggregates: LocalAggregateState,
    
    // Global aggregation across partitions  
    global_coordinator: GlobalAggregateCoordinator,
    
    // Pre-aggregation to reduce network overhead
    pre_aggregate_threshold: usize,
}
```

### Vertical Scaling Optimizations

#### 1. Multi-Core Query Execution
```rust
// Parallel query execution within a single node
pub struct ParallelQueryExecutor {
    thread_pool: ThreadPool,
    work_stealing_queue: WorkStealingQueue<QueryTask>,
    numa_aware_allocation: bool,
}

// Per-core query processing
impl ParallelQueryExecutor {
    pub async fn execute_parallel(&self, query: StreamingQuery) -> Result<Stream, SqlError> {
        let parallelizable_operations = self.identify_parallel_ops(&query)?;
        
        // Split operations across CPU cores
        let parallel_streams = parallelizable_operations
            .into_iter()
            .map(|op| self.execute_on_core(op))
            .collect::<Vec<_>>();
            
        // Merge results maintaining event ordering
        self.merge_ordered_streams(parallel_streams).await
    }
}
```

#### 2. Memory-Efficient State Management
```rust
// Scalable state storage for large aggregations
pub struct ScalableStateStore {
    // Hot data in memory for fast access
    hot_cache: LruCache<StateKey, StateValue>,
    
    // Warm data in compressed memory
    warm_storage: CompressedHashMap<StateKey, StateValue>,
    
    // Cold data persisted to disk
    cold_storage: RocksDbStateStore,
    
    // Automatic data temperature management
    temperature_manager: StateTemperatureManager,
}

// Tiered storage configuration
let state_config = StateConfig::new()
    .hot_cache_size_mb(512)
    .warm_compression_ratio(0.3)
    .cold_storage_path("/data/sql_state")
    .eviction_policy(EvictionPolicy::LeastRecentlyUsed);
```

#### 3. Adaptive Resource Management
```rust
// Dynamic resource allocation based on query load
pub struct AdaptiveResourceManager {
    cpu_monitor: CpuUsageMonitor,
    memory_monitor: MemoryPressureMonitor,
    backpressure_detector: BackpressureDetector,
}

impl AdaptiveResourceManager {
    pub fn adjust_query_resources(&self, query_id: QueryId) -> ResourceAdjustment {
        let current_load = self.assess_system_load();
        
        match current_load {
            SystemLoad::Low => ResourceAdjustment::IncreaseParallelism,
            SystemLoad::Medium => ResourceAdjustment::Maintain,
            SystemLoad::High => ResourceAdjustment::ReduceMemoryFootprint,
            SystemLoad::Critical => ResourceAdjustment::EnableBackpressure,
        }
    }
}
```

### Scaling Patterns and Deployment Models

#### 1. Microservice-Based SQL Processing
```rust
// Deploy SQL queries as independent microservices
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct SqlMicroservice {
    query_definition: String,
    input_topics: Vec<String>,
    output_topic: String,
    scaling_config: ScalingConfig,
}

// Kubernetes-native deployment with auto-scaling
pub struct KubernetesScalingConfig {
    min_replicas: u32,
    max_replicas: u32,
    target_cpu_utilization: f32,
    target_memory_utilization: f32,
    
    // Custom metrics for SQL-specific scaling
    target_events_per_second: u64,
    target_query_latency_ms: u64,
}
```

#### 2. Edge Computing and Geo-Distribution
```rust
// Hierarchical processing for global scale
pub struct GeoDistributedSqlProcessor {
    // Edge nodes for regional processing
    edge_processors: HashMap<Region, EdgeSqlProcessor>,
    
    // Central aggregation for global queries
    central_aggregator: CentralSqlAggregator,
    
    // Data locality optimization
    locality_optimizer: DataLocalityOptimizer,
}

// Regional processing with global aggregation
sql_context.execute_geo_distributed("
    -- Process locally at each region
    WITH regional_stats AS (
        SELECT 
            region,
            COUNT(*) as local_count,
            AVG(latency) as local_avg_latency
        FROM requests
        WHERE region = CURRENT_REGION()
        GROUP BY region
        WINDOW TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)
    )
    
    -- Aggregate globally across regions
    SELECT 
        SUM(local_count) as global_count,
        AVG(local_avg_latency) as global_avg_latency
    FROM regional_stats
    GROUP BY TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)
").await?;
```

### Performance Scaling Techniques

#### 1. Query Optimization for Scale
```rust
// Automatic query optimization for high throughput
pub struct ScalabilityOptimizer {
    statistics_collector: StreamingStatsCollector,
    cost_estimator: CostEstimator,
    execution_planner: ExecutionPlanner,
}

impl ScalabilityOptimizer {
    pub fn optimize_for_scale(&self, query: &StreamingQuery) -> OptimizedQuery {
        let stats = self.statistics_collector.get_stream_stats();
        
        // Optimize based on data characteristics
        let optimizations = match stats.cardinality {
            Cardinality::Low => vec![
                Optimization::PreAggregation,
                Optimization::MemoryOptimized,
            ],
            Cardinality::High => vec![
                Optimization::PartitionedExecution,
                Optimization::HierarchicalAggregation,
                Optimization::StateCompression,
            ],
            Cardinality::VeryHigh => vec![

}
```

#### 2. Elastic Scaling Based on Query Load
```rust
// Automatic scaling based on SQL query metrics
pub struct ElasticSqlScaler {
    metrics_collector: QueryMetricsCollector,
    scaling_predictor: LoadPredictor,
    resource_provisioner: ResourceProvisioner,
}

// Scaling triggers and policies
pub struct ScalingPolicy {
    // Scale up when query latency exceeds threshold
    latency_threshold_ms: u64,
    
    // Scale up when backpressure detected
    backpressure_threshold: f32,
    
    // Scale down when resources underutilized
    idle_threshold_percentage: f32,
    
    // Scaling rate limits to prevent thrashing
    scale_up_cooldown: Duration,
    scale_down_cooldown: Duration,
}
```

### Monitoring and Observability for Scale

#### 1. Distributed Query Tracing
```rust
// End-to-end tracing across distributed SQL execution
pub struct DistributedQueryTracer {
    span_collector: SpanCollector,
    trace_aggregator: TraceAggregator,
    performance_analyzer: PerformanceAnalyzer,
}

// Query execution tracing
#[tracing::instrument(skip(self))]
pub async fn execute_traced_query(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Stream, SqlError> {
    let span = tracing::info_span!("sql_query_execution", query = query);
    
    // Trace across all participating nodes
    let distributed_span = self.create_distributed_span(&span)?;
    
    // Execute with distributed tracing
    self.execute_with_tracing(query, distributed_span).await
}
```

#### 2. Scalability Metrics and Alerting
```rust
// Comprehensive metrics for scaling decisions
pub struct ScalabilityMetrics {
    // Throughput metrics
    pub events_processed_per_second: Counter,
    pub queries_executed_per_second: Counter,
    
    // Latency metrics
    pub query_execution_latency: Histogram,
    pub end_to_end_latency: Histogram,
    
    // Resource utilization
    pub cpu_utilization_percentage: Gauge,
    pub memory_utilization_percentage: Gauge,
    pub network_bandwidth_utilization: Gauge,
    
    // Scaling-specific metrics
    pub partition_skew_factor: Gauge,
    pub rebalancing_frequency: Counter,
    pub state_migration_duration: Histogram,
}
```

## Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing ferrisstreams applications remain unchanged
- SQL features are additive, not replacing existing APIs
- Gradual migration path from programmatic to SQL-based processing

### Interoperability
```rust
// Mix SQL and programmatic processing
let sql_stream = sql_context.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 1000").await?;
let processed_stream = sql_stream
    .map(|record| transform_record(record))
    .filter(|record| custom_filter(record));
```

## Open Questions

1. **SQL Dialect**: Which SQL standard to target (ANSI SQL, PostgreSQL, custom)?
2. **Schema Evolution**: How to handle schema changes in Kafka topics?
3. **Error Handling**: How to surface SQL errors in a streaming context?
4. **Resource Management**: How to prevent runaway queries from affecting other streams?
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to test SQL correctness and performance at scale?

## Conclusion

Adding streaming-native SQL support to ferrisstreams would create a unique position in the Kafka ecosystem: a high-performance, type-safe, SQL-capable streaming platform built entirely in Rust with true streaming semantics from the ground up.

The streaming-native SQL engine ensures:
- **True Streaming Performance**: Event-at-a-time processing with no batch/streaming impedance mismatch
- **Rust Safety Guarantees**: Type safety and memory safety throughout the query execution pipeline  
- **Kafka-Native Integration**: Deep integration with ferrisstreams' Message, Headers, and KTable abstractions
- **Enterprise Scale**: Horizontal and vertical scaling with distributed execution capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Built-in backpressure, fault tolerance, operational monitoring, and elastic scaling

This approach differentiates ferrisstreams by providing SQL accessibility without compromising the performance, safety, and streaming semantics that make Rust compelling for real-time data processing. The comprehensive scaling architecture ensures the solution can handle enterprise-grade workloads while maintaining the simplicity and elegance of SQL for stream processing.
