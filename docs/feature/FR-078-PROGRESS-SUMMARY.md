### Subquery Support (Ongoing)

### Phase 1-2: Documentation Transparency & BETA Status

**Status**: ‚úÖ DELIVERED (2 commits, 71 insertions)

#### Changes Made

1. **`/docs/sql/subquery-support.md`** - Updated
   - Added prominent BETA (v0.1) status notice
   - Clear separation of "Currently Working Features" vs "Not Yet Implemented"
   - HAVING EXISTS/NOT EXISTS marked as working
   - WHERE EXISTS/Scalar/IN/NOT IN/ANY/ALL marked as "not yet implemented"
   - Updated roadmap for future phases

2. **`/docs/sql/subquery-quick-reference.md`** - Updated
   - Added BETA status warning at top
   - Created "Supported Patterns - What Works vs What Errors" section
   - Explicit ‚úÖ WORKS markers for HAVING EXISTS/NOT EXISTS
   - Explicit ‚ùå WILL ERROR markers with actual error messages
   - Set clear user expectations upfront

#### Impact

- ‚úÖ Users now know exactly what works and what doesn't
- ‚úÖ Error messages are documented and explained
- ‚úÖ No more surprises from misleading "production-ready" claims
- ‚úÖ Clear roadmap for future implementation phases

**Commit**: `fd46500` - "feat: Phase 1+2 - Subquery Documentation Transparency & BETA Status"

---

### Phase 3: WHERE EXISTS Architecture Analysis

**Status**: ‚úÖ DELIVERED (1 commit, 398 insertions, 2 documents)

#### Analysis Scope

- ‚úÖ SubqueryExecutor trait design reviewed
- ‚úÖ SelectProcessor implementation analyzed
- ‚úÖ ExpressionEvaluator dual paths identified
- ‚úÖ HAVING EXISTS success path understood
- ‚úÖ WHERE EXISTS integration point located
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure readiness assessed

#### Key Findings

**The Infrastructure Paradox**:
- SubqueryExecutor trait: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- SelectProcessor methods: ‚úÖ 100% Complete & Working
- Expression evaluator paths: ‚úÖ Enhanced path fully implemented
- HAVING EXISTS: ‚úÖ Proves everything works (7 passing tests)
- WHERE EXISTS: ‚ùå Not wired, throws "not yet implemented"

**Root Cause**: WHERE clauses use basic evaluator path that throws errors instead of delegating to the enhanced evaluator path that works.

**Solution**: Single change - switch WHERE clause processing to use `evaluate_expression_with_subqueries()` instead of `evaluate_expression()`.

#### Deliverables

1. **New Document**: `fr-078-WHERE-EXISTS-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` (272 lines)
   - Detailed architecture breakdown
   - Code locations with line numbers
   - Why HAVING EXISTS works but WHERE EXISTS doesn't
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Verification steps for testing

2. **Enhanced Document**: `fr-078-comprehensive-subquery-analysis.md` (Part 9 + 10)
   - Part 9: WHERE EXISTS Implementation Readiness (133 lines)
   - Part 10: Implementation Progress Tracking (197 lines)
   - Complete roadmap for all phases
   - Quality metrics and risk assessment
   - Success criteria and communication plan

#### Impact

- ‚úÖ Clear path forward for Phase 4 development
- ‚úÖ Zero architectural blockers identified
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure proven with HAVING EXISTS tests
- ‚úÖ Implementation effort estimated at 4-5 hours (low risk)

**Commit**: `af83734` - "docs: Add WHERE EXISTS implementation analysis and architecture findings"

**Enhanced Commit**: `5f83c91` - "docs: Add Part 10 - Implementation Progress Tracking with detailed roadmap"

## üéØ Phase 4: WHERE EXISTS Implementation (READY)

### Scope
Enable WHERE EXISTS/NOT EXISTS by wiring WHERE clause processing to enhanced evaluator

### Key Change
```rust
// Change FROM:
let where_result = ExpressionEvaluator::evaluate_expression(where_expr, record)?;

// Change TO:
let where_result = ExpressionEvaluator::evaluate_expression_with_subqueries(
    where_expr,
    record,
    self,  // SelectProcessor implements SubqueryExecutor
    &context,
)?;
```

### Estimated Effort: 4-5 hours

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Identify WHERE clause locations | 30 min | Already documented |
| Create implementation branch | 5 min | Standard git workflow |
| Update WHERE clause processing | 1 hour | Main implementation work |
| Wire SELECT clause if needed | 30 min | Conditional based on findings |
| Test existing parser tests | 30 min | Ensure compatibility |
| Enable WHERE EXISTS unit tests | 30 min | Activate existing tests |
| Verify HAVING EXISTS still works | 15 min | Regression testing |
| Performance baseline | 30 min | Establish metrics |
| Update documentation | 30 min | Reflect changes |

### Risk Assessment: LOW
