**# Feature Request: MultiJobSqlServer Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the feature enhancements and improvements for the MultiJobSqlServer component, a critical part of the Velo SQL streaming platform that manages multiple concurrent SQL jobs.

## Background
The MultiJobSqlServer enables deployment and management of multiple SQL streaming jobs simultaneously, providing a foundation for scalable real-time data processing applications.

## Completed Features âœ…

### Critical Infrastructure
- **CRITICAL**: Moved MultiJobSqlServer to lib crate for unit testing
- **CRITICAL**: Added core unit tests (deploy_job, stop_job, list_jobs)
- **CRITICAL**: Implemented max jobs limit enforcement testing
- **CRITICAL**: Added duplicate job name rejection testing

### Job Management
- **HIGH**: Implemented job lifecycle (start/stop) transitions testing
- **HIGH**: Added invalid SQL query handling tests
- **HIGH**: Implemented concurrent job deployment and management testing
- **MEDIUM**: Added job status tracking and metrics testing

### System Cleanup & Architecture
- Removed broken pause_job functionality
- Removed ALL demo jobs from multi-job server (made app-agnostic)
- Added --no-auto-deploy flag to multi-job server
- Moved demo artifacts to trading folder
- Moved trading_data_generator to demo folder

### CLI & Remote Support
- Added remote server support to velo-cli
- Designed interactive CLI session features
- Added remote Kafka broker support
- Updated CLI with remote connection options
- Fixed velo-cli Kafka container detection logic

### Demo & Documentation
- Fixed trading demo SQL processing
- Fixed demo to reference main project artifacts
- Fixed deploy-app command usage in trading demo script
- Fixed Docker SSL certificate issues in trading demo build
- Updated trading demo to use multi-job server
- Updated documentation with remote usage
- Created CLI feature request documentation
- Created feature request document for trading demo

### Testing & Quality
- Written comprehensive test for multi-job server with job verification
- Fixed empty Grafana dashboards - investigated data sources and metrics

## Pending Features ðŸ”„

### High Priority
- **HIGH**: Test Kafka connection failure scenarios

### Medium Priority
- **MEDIUM**: Test resource cleanup on job termination
- **MEDIUM**: Add performance benchmarks (jobs/sec, memory usage)
- **MEDIUM**: Test job execution with real data flow

### Development Features
- Implement SQL execution in velo-cli
- Add streaming query capabilities
- Implement configuration management features
- Add HTTP endpoints for remote monitoring

### Low Priority & Future Enhancements
- **LOW**: Add chaos testing (network failures, process crashes)
- **LOW**: Add load testing (high throughput scenarios)
- **LOW**: Add HTTP API tests when endpoints are implemented
- **FUTURE**: Implement proper pause/resume with job control channels

## Success Criteria
- All critical unit tests passing
- Robust error handling for network failures
- Performance benchmarks established
- Remote monitoring capabilities
- Full SQL execution support in CLI
- Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

## Technical Notes
- MultiJobSqlServer is now properly testable in lib crate
- App-agnostic design allows for flexible deployment scenarios
- Remote connection support enables distributed deployments
- Comprehensive test suite ensures reliability and stability**
