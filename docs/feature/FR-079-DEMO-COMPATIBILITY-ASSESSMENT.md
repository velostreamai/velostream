---

## Detailed Analysis by Feature

### Phase 5: ORDER BY Sorting - HIGH UTILIZATION ✅

#### ORDER BY Clauses in Demo (18 total)

All ORDER BY clauses appear **within window functions** in OVER clauses:

**1. Price Movement Analysis (Lines 144-154)**
```sql
LAG(price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time)
LEAD(price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time)
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY price DESC)
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY volume DESC)
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY price)
```
- **Status**: ✅ Window function ORDER BY (parsed, needs enforcement via Phase 8)
- **Phase 5 Impact**: OrderProcessor validates and enforces ordering
- **Additional Need**: Phase 8 to validate OVER clause ORDER BY semantics

**2. Volatility Calculation (Lines 157-161)**
```sql
STDDEV(price) OVER (
    PARTITION BY symbol
    ORDER BY event_time
    ROWS BETWEEN 9 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) as price_volatility_10_periods
```
- **Status**: ✅ Window frame with ORDER BY dependency
- **Phase 5 Impact**: Sorting within frame boundaries
- **Phase 8 Impact**: Frame boundary validation

**3. Volume Analysis (Lines 280-297)**
```sql
AVG(volume) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN...)
STDDEV_POP(volume) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN...)
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY volume ROWS BETWEEN...)
```
- **Status**: ✅ Multiple window functions with ORDER BY
- **Phase 5 Impact**: Critical for per-record ordering
- **Phase 8 Impact**: Frame boundary semantics

**4. Risk Monitoring (Lines 406-445)**
```sql
SUM(p.current_pnl) OVER (
    PARTITION BY p.trader_id
    ORDER BY p.event_time
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS cumulative_pnl

COUNT(*) OVER (
    PARTITION BY p.trader_id
    ORDER BY p.event_time
    RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS trades_today
```
- **Status**: ✅ Complex window functions with ORDER BY
- **Phase 5 Impact**: Essential for cumulative calculations
- **Phase 8 Impact**: INTERVAL frame boundary support

#### Current Status Without Phase 5-8

**Problem**: ORDER BY appears in window function OVER clauses but:
- ✅ Parser: Works correctly (parses all 18 clauses)
- ❌ Execution: Not enforced - rows processed in arbitrary order
- ❌ Validation: No checking that ORDER BY fields exist in scope
- ❌ Semantics: Window frames computed without proper ordering

**Impact on Demo**: Window functions produce incorrect results because:
- LAG/LEAD functions don't see data in correct temporal order
- Rank functions don't rank in correct order
- Cumulative aggregations accumulate in wrong sequence
- Per-record ordering ignored

#### Impact of Phase 5-8 Implementation

**Phase 5 (ORDER BY Sorting)**:
- ✅ Enforce ORDER BY in window function OVER clauses
- ✅ Validate field existence and types
- ✅ Proper row ordering for LAG/LEAD/RANK/DENSE_RANK

**Phase 8 (Window Frame Validation)**:
- ✅ Validate ROWS BETWEEN specifications
- ✅ Validate RANGE BETWEEN with INTERVAL syntax
- ✅ Proper frame boundary semantics

**Result**: Demo now produces **correct** window function results

---

### Phase 6: Type Validation - MEDIUM UTILIZATION ✅

#### Type Operations in Demo

**1. Arithmetic with Division (Lines 148-149)**
```sql
(price - LAG(price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time)) /
 LAG(price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time) * 100 as price_change_pct
```
- **Type Path**: Float / Float * Integer → Float
- **Status**: ✅ Type coercion compatible with Phase 6
- **Validation**: Ensures divisor is non-zero (handled in logic)

**2. Comparison Operations (Lines 165-168)**
```sql
ABS((price - LAG(...)) / LAG(...)) * 100 > 5.0 THEN 'SIGNIFICANT'
ABS((price - LAG(...)) / LAG(...)) * 100 > 2.0 THEN 'MODERATE'
```
- **Type Path**: Float > Float → Boolean
- **Status**: ✅ Direct type compatibility
- **Validation**: Phase 6 ensures numeric types for comparison

**3. Multiplication with NULL Handling (Line 424)**
```sql
ABS(p.position_size * COALESCE(m.price, 0)) AS position_value
```
- **Type Path**: Integer * (Float | 0) → Float
- **Status**: ✅ Type coercion with NULL safety
- **Validation**: Phase 6 validates COALESCE result type

**4. Statistical Aggregation (Line 304)**
```sql
ABS((MAX(volume) - AVG(volume)) / STDDEV_POP(volume)) > 2.0
```
- **Type Path**: Float / Float → Float (comparison)
- **Status**: ✅ Compatible with Phase 6 type validation
- **Edge Case**: STDDEV_POP must not be zero (app handles)

**5. Window Function Type Operations (Lines 426-430)**
```sql
SUM(ABS(p.position_size * COALESCE(m.price, 0))) OVER (...)
```
- **Type Path**: SUM(Float) → Float (window aggregation)
- **Status**: ✅ Phase 6 validates type compatibility
- **Validation**: Ensures numeric types in SUM

#### Current Status Without Phase 6

**Parser Status**: ✅ All types parsed correctly
**Execution Status**: ✅ Type operations work (f64/i64 coercion implicit)
**Validation Status**: ❌ No type checking - could mask bugs

**Examples of Issues Phase 6 Would Catch**:
- Comparing String to Integer (current: silent failure)
- Aggregating String fields (current: runtime error)
- Invalid COALESCE type mismatch (current: type mismatch at runtime)

#### Impact of Phase 6 Implementation

**Benefits for Demo**:
- ✅ Early error detection for type mismatches
- ✅ Clear error messages for developers
- ✅ Prevents undefined behavior in financial calculations
- ✅ Validates COALESCE result types

**Demo Compatibility**: ✅ 100% - Demo uses only compatible type operations

---

### Phase 7: Aggregation Validation - HIGH COMPLEXITY ✅

#### Aggregation Patterns in Demo

**1. Basic GROUP BY with Aggregates (Lines 92-106)**
```sql
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*), AVG(price), MIN/MAX(price), SUM(volume)
FROM market_data_ts
GROUP BY symbol
WINDOW TUMBLING(event_time, INTERVAL '1' SECOND)
```
- **Status**: ✅ Standard GROUP BY with multiple aggregates
- **Phase 7 Check**: All non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY ✓
- **Validation**: Passes Phase 7 completeness check

**2. Complex Aggregation with Derived Fields (Lines 268-307)**
```sql
SELECT
    symbol,
    _window_start, _window_end,
    COUNT(*), AVG(volume), STDDEV_POP(volume), MAX(volume), MIN(volume),
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (...),
    CASE WHEN AVG(volume) > 0 AND MAX(volume) > 5 * AVG(volume) THEN 'EXTREME_SPIKE' ...
FROM market_data_ts
GROUP BY symbol
```
- **Status**: ✅ Mixed aggregates and window functions
- **Phase 7 Complexity**: High - multiple aggregation levels
- **Validation Requirements**:
  - ✓ Aggregate functions only in SELECT/HAVING
  - ✓ All GROUP BY fields present
  - ✓ Window functions separate from GROUP BY aggregates

**3. HAVING Clause with Complex Conditions (Lines 584-589)**
```sql
GROUP BY symbol
HAVING
    SUM(quantity) > 10000
   AND (
    SUM(CASE WHEN side = 'BUY' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) / SUM(quantity) > 0.7
    OR SUM(CASE WHEN side = 'SELL' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) / SUM(quantity) > 0.7
    )
WINDOW TUMBLING (event_time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)
```
- **Status**: ✅ Advanced HAVING with multiple aggregates and CASE
- **Phase 7 Check**:
  - Aggregate functions in HAVING ✓
  - No GROUP BY fields in HAVING (correct) ✓
  - SUM(CASE...) patterns valid ✓
- **Validation**: Passes all Phase 7 checks

**4. Window-Based Aggregation in Risk Monitor (Lines 406-445)**
```sql
SUM(p.current_pnl) OVER (PARTITION BY trader_id ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN...)
COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY trader_id ORDER BY event_time RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' DAY...)
STDDEV(p.current_pnl) OVER (PARTITION BY trader_id ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN...)
```
- **Status**: ✅ Window functions (not GROUP BY aggregates)
- **Phase 7 Distinction**: Window functions are separate from GROUP BY
- **Validation**: Phase 7 correctly identifies these as window functions

#### Aggregation Validation Summary

| Query Pattern | Count | Phase 7 Status | Notes |
|--------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Simple GROUP BY | 5 | ✅ PASS | All non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY |
| GROUP BY + HAVING | 3 | ✅ PASS | HAVING uses only aggregates |
| Window Functions | 4+ | ✅ PASS | Not GROUP BY aggregates - no validation needed |
| Mixed Aggregation | 2 | ✅ PASS | Both GROUP BY and window functions |
| **TOTAL** | **15+** | ✅ 100% PASS | All patterns supported |

#### Current Status Without Phase 7

**Parser Status**: ✅ All aggregation patterns parsed
**Execution Status**: ✅ GROUP BY aggregation works correctly
**Validation Status**: ❌ No validation of:
- Non-aggregated columns outside GROUP BY
- Aggregate functions in WHERE clause
- GROUP BY completeness

**Demo Risk**: Moderate - Complex aggregations could silently compute wrong results if columns accidentally omitted from GROUP BY

#### Impact of Phase 7 Implementation

**Benefits for Demo**:
- ✅ Prevents GROUP BY completeness errors
- ✅ Early detection of invalid aggregation usage
- ✅ Clear error messages for aggregation violations
- ✅ Safe for high-stakes financial calculations

**Demo Status Post-Phase-7**: ✅ All 15+ aggregation patterns validated

---

### Phase 8: Window Frame Validation - CRITICAL FEATURE ✅

#### Window Frame Specifications in Demo

**1. ROWS BETWEEN Specifications (10+ instances)**

```sql
-- Line 157-161: Price volatility with row-based frame
STDDEV(price) OVER (
    PARTITION BY symbol
    ORDER BY event_time
    ROWS BETWEEN 9 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)

-- Lines 280-290: Volume analysis with row frames
AVG(volume) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING)
STDDEV_POP(volume) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING)

-- Lines 409-430: Risk calculations with cumulative frames
SUM(p.current_pnl) OVER (PARTITION BY trader_id ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
STDDEV(p.current_pnl) OVER (PARTITION BY trader_id ORDER BY event_time ROWS BETWEEN 99 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

**Phase 8 Validation**:
- ✅ ROWS frame bounds all valid (UNBOUNDED, numeric, CURRENT ROW)
- ✅ All require ORDER BY (present in all cases)
- ✅ Frame ordering correct (PRECEDING before FOLLOWING)

**2. RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL Specifications (Critical!)**

```sql
-- Lines 414-416: Last 24 hours count
COUNT(*) OVER (
    PARTITION BY p.trader_id
    ORDER BY p.event_time
    RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS trades_today
```

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **Parser supports INTERVAL, execution needs Phase 8 validation**
- ✅ Parser: Correctly parses INTERVAL '1' DAY
- ❌ Execution: No validation that INTERVAL type matches ORDER BY field type
- ❌ Semantics: No enforcement that ORDER BY field is temporal

**Phase 8 Impact**:
- ✅ Validate ORDER BY field is timestamp/date type
- ✅ Validate INTERVAL unit matches field precision
- ✅ Prevent RANGE with numeric ORDER BY + INTERVAL (incompatible)

**3. UNBOUNDED Frame Specifications**

```sql
-- Lines 426-430: Cumulative exposure
SUM(ABS(p.position_size * COALESCE(m.price, 0))) OVER (
    PARTITION BY p.trader_id
    ORDER BY p.event_time
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS total_exposure
```

**Phase 8 Validation**:
- ✅ UNBOUNDED PRECEDING recognized
- ✅ CURRENT ROW end bound valid
- ✅ Cumulative semantics correct

#### Window Frame Validation Summary

| Frame Type | Count | Current Status | Phase 8 Impact | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| ROWS BETWEEN numeric | 8 | ✅ Works | ✅ Validates bounds | ✅ FULL |
| ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | 3 | ✅ Works | ✅ Validates syntax | ✅ FULL |
| RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL | 1 | ⚠️ Parsed | ✅ Validates type match | 🔧 CRITICAL |
| **TOTAL** | **12+** | Mixed | Will be Complete | **Important** |

#### Current Critical Issue: RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL

**Problem**: The demo uses RANGE with INTERVAL at line 415:
```sql
RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

**Current State**:
- ✅ Parser accepts it
- ⚠️ OrderProcessor may not handle temporal RANGE correctly
- ⚠️ Phase 8 validation doesn't yet exist

**What Phase 8 Adds**:
1. ✅ Validates ORDER BY field is temporal type (timestamp/date)
2. ✅ Validates INTERVAL unit is compatible (DAY for timestamp ✓)
3. ✅ Prevents invalid combinations (INTERVAL with integer ORDER BY ✗)
4. ✅ Proper temporal window semantics

**Demo Implication**:
- trades_today calculation requires Phase 8 for correctness
- Currently may compute incorrectly or fail at runtime
- Phase 8 ensures it works as designed

#### Phase 8 Critical Requirements for Demo

**Must Handle**:
1. ✅ INTERVAL '1' DAY with TIMESTAMP fields
2. ✅ ROWS BETWEEN with numeric bounds
3. ✅ UNBOUNDED PRECEDING/FOLLOWING
4. ✅ CURRENT ROW as frame boundary
5. ✅ Cumulative frame semantics (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING to CURRENT ROW)

**Demo Pattern Coverage**: 100% - All patterns represented in demo
