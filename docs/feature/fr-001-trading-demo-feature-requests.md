# FerrisStreams Trading Demo - Feature Requests

This document outlines proposed enhancements and new features for the FerrisStreams Financial Trading Demo.

## üéØ Current Demo Status

The trading demo currently provides:
- ‚úÖ Real-time market data generation for 8 major tech stocks
- ‚úÖ Basic financial trading analytics (volume spike detection)
- ‚úÖ Kafka-based stream processing
- ‚úÖ Grafana monitoring dashboards
- ‚úÖ CLI management and monitoring tools

2. Risk Management Monitor (position limits, P&L tracking)  
3. Order Flow Imbalance Detection (buy/sell ratio analysis)
4. Arbitrage Opportunities (cross-exchange price differences)
```

**Implementation:**
- Fix multi-job SQL server to not auto-deploy conflicting demo jobs
- Deploy all 5 financial trading analytics jobs
- Ensure each job writes to its respective output topic
- Add monitoring for all alert topics

**Expected Outcome:**
- Complete real-time trading analytics pipeline
- Rich data flowing to `price_alerts`, `risk_alerts`, `arbitrage_opportunities` topics
- Meaningful demo showing actual financial use cases
