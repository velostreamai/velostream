## Phase 6.4: ✅ COMPLETE - Per-Partition Engine Architecture Optimization

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (November 9, 2025)
**Impact**: ~2x throughput improvement across all scenarios
**Effort**: **S** (Small - straightforward ownership transfer)

### What Was Done

**Problem Identified**:
- Shared `Arc<RwLock<StreamExecutionEngine>>` forced all partitions to contend for locks
- Mandatory state clones could not cross lock boundaries
- Write lock serialized updates across partitions
- ~1-2ms overhead per batch round with 8 partitions

**Solution Implemented**:
- Each partition now has its **OWN StreamExecutionEngine** (not shared)
- Eliminated RwLock wrapper entirely for owned engines
- Direct owned access to state without lock guards
- True single-threaded per-partition execution

**Code Changes**:
- `src/velostream/server/v2/coordinator.rs:881-883` - Per-partition engine creation
- `src/velostream/server/v2/coordinator.rs:977` - Owned mutable engine in partition_pipeline
- `src/velostream/server/v2/coordinator.rs:1101` - Direct engine access in execute_batch_for_partition
- `src/velostream/server/v2/coordinator.rs:1114` - State access without locks
- `src/velostream/server/v2/coordinator.rs:1140-1141` - Direct state updates without write lock

**Testing**:
- ✅ All 530 unit tests pass (no behavioral changes)
- ✅ All 5 benchmark scenarios complete with improved metrics
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ All pre-commit checks pass

## Phase 6.4C: Eliminate State Duplication (PLANNED)

**Status**: 📋 PLANNED
**Effort**: **M** (Medium - 2-3 days)
**Expected Improvement**: +5-10% additional throughput
**Target**: ~730-750K rec/sec (Scenario 0)

### The Problem Solved

Currently, state lives in **TWO places**:
- **StreamExecutionEngine** holds `group_states` (master copy)
- **ProcessorContext** holds `group_by_states` (working copy)
- **Manual synchronization** copies state back and forth (~20 locations)

This violates the distributed streaming principle: **state should attach to the processing unit (partition), not the global engine**.

### Solution: ProcessorContext as Single Source of Truth

**Change**: Move state from StreamExecutionEngine to PartitionStateManager
- StreamExecutionEngine becomes stateless (just executes)
- PartitionStateManager owns state (lives with partition)
- ProcessorContext accesses partition state (no copying)
- Processors continue to use context (no changes needed)

### Implementation Path

1. **Remove state from StreamExecutionEngine** (4 hours)
   - Delete `group_states` field
   - Delete `get_group_states()` and `set_group_states()` methods
   - Remove all synchronization code (~20 locations)

2. **Add state to PartitionStateManager** (8 hours)
   - Add `group_by_states: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<...>>>`
   - Initialize state on first record
   - Persist across records
   - Update ProcessorContext initialization

3. **Testing & Validation** (4 hours)
   - Run comprehensive baseline test
   - Verify state persistence
   - Check performance improvement

### Expected Benefits

- ✅ **Single source of truth** (no duplication)
- ✅ **Distributed-ready** (state attached to partition)
- ✅ **Performance** (5-10% from eliminating HashMap clones)
- ✅ **Cleaner code** (remove 20+ synchronization lines)
- ✅ **Better testability** (easier to mock state)

### Dependency: MUST BE DONE BEFORE Phase 6.5

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Phase 6.4C enables Phase 6.5 optimization.

**Why**: Phase 6.5 also needs to move window state from engine to partition manager.
- **6.4C** removes `group_states` from engine
- **6.5** can then remove `window_v2_states` from engine
- Same pattern: engine becomes stateless, partitions own all state
- If 6.5 done first: would move window state, then 6.4C moves group state (messy)
- If 6.4C done first: clears the path for 6.5 (clean architecture)

### Documentation

See **FR-082-STATE-SHARING-ANALYSIS.md** for detailed analysis, architectural comparison with Flink/Kafka Streams, and complete implementation plan.

## Phase 6.5: Window State Optimization (PLANNED)

**Status**: 📋 PLANNED (after 6.4C)
**Effort**: **M** (Medium - 2-3 days, REDUCED because 6.4C already refactored state handling)
**Expected Improvement**: +5-15% additional throughput
**Target**: ~850K-900K rec/sec (Scenario 0)

### Dependency on Phase 6.4C

Phase 6.4C completes the pattern for moving state from engine to partitions:
- 6.4C moves `group_states` to PartitionStateManager
- 6.5 applies same pattern to `window_v2_states`
- No need to refactor the architecture twice - just extend it

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Per-Partition Window Managers**
   - Move window state from StreamExecutionEngine to PartitionStateManager
   - Each partition manages its own windows independently
   - Eliminates window state synchronization overhead (same pattern as 6.4C)

2. **Lazy Window Initialization**
   - Don't pre-allocate window state
   - Initialize only when first record arrives for that window
   - Reduces memory footprint and initialization time

3. **Memory Pooling for Window Accumulators**
   - Reuse window accumulator objects across batches
   - Avoid allocation/deallocation overhead
   - Particularly effective for high-cardinality windows

### Implementation Path

1. Extract window management from StreamExecutionEngine
2. Create WindowManager trait per partition
3. Implement lazy initialization pattern
4. Add memory pooling for common window types
5. Benchmark and validate improvements

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Record Streaming Instead of Batching**
   - Process records as they arrive instead of batch-at-a-time
   - Reduce latency and memory buffering

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Atomic Operations for All Metrics**
   - Currently using some atomics, can expand
   - Replace any remaining lock-based metrics
   - Use proper memory ordering

2. **Thread-Local Accumulation**
   - Accumulate metrics locally per partition
   - Publish to global metrics periodically
   - Reduces atomic contention

3. **Batch-Level Metric Updates**
   - Update metrics once per batch instead of per-record
   - Reduces atomic operation frequency
   - Still maintains accuracy

### Implementation Path

1. Audit current metrics collection
2. Convert remaining locks to atomics
3. Implement thread-local accumulation
4. Batch metric updates
5. Validate with metrics benchmarks

**Status**: 📋 FUTURE PLANNING
**Effort**: **XL** (Extra Large - 2-4 weeks)
**Expected Improvement**: +2-3x additional throughput
**Target**: **2-3M rec/sec** (multi-scenario average)

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **SIMD Aggregations**
   - Vectorize COUNT, SUM operations
   - Process multiple records in parallel with vector instructions
   - Particularly effective for GROUP BY

2. **Batch-Level Vectorization**
   - Process entire batches with vector operations
   - Predicate pushdown for filtering
   - Early termination for aggregations

3. **Memory Layout Optimization**
   - Column-oriented storage for batch processing
   - Cache-friendly data layout
   - Reduce memory bandwidth requirements

### Implementation Path

1. Profile hot aggregation paths
2. Identify vectorizable patterns
3. Implement SIMD versions of common operations
4. Benchmark and validate
