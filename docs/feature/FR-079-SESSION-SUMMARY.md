## üìä Session Deliverables

### Analysis Phase ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**4 Comprehensive Analysis Documents Created** (57.3 KB total):

1. **FR-079-EMIT-CHANGES-WINDOW-GROUP-BY-ANALYSIS.md** (9.3 KB)
   - Technical root cause analysis
   - Architecture flow diagrams
   - GROUP BY detection and splitting strategy
   - Multi-result emission options with trade-offs

2. **FR-079-EMIT-CHANGES-WINDOW-GAP-ANALYSIS.md** (11 KB)
   - Why feature was missed (documented gap)
   - Official "NOT IMPLEMENTED" references
   - Documentation contradictions discovered
   - Timeline and scope decisions
   - Test coverage metrics game explanation

3. **FR-079-EMIT-CHANGES-WINDOWED-IMPLEMENTATION.md** (12 KB)
   - High-level design specification
   - 4-phase implementation architecture
   - Integration points and strategy
   - Testing and performance considerations
   - Estimated effort: 12-17 hours

4. **FR-079-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** (25 KB) - THE MASTER PLAN
   - Detailed 4-phase breakdown with 20 tasks
   - Line-number-specific code locations
   - 20+ code examples and templates
   - 10+ test case matrix
   - Pre-implementation, execution, and code review checklists (50+ items)
   - Success metrics and performance targets

## üîç Key Findings

### Root Cause
```
Window processor returns Option<StreamRecord> (single result)
         ‚Üì
Cannot emit multiple per-group results needed for GROUP BY EMIT CHANGES
         ‚Üì
Need to change return type to Vec<StreamRecord> and add GROUP BY logic
```

### Why It Was Missed
- ‚úÖ **Intentional Deferral**: Explicitly marked "NOT IMPLEMENTED" in design docs
- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage Game**: 30+ tests written to boost metrics, but feature not implemented
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Contradiction**: emit-modes.md shows as valid, other doc marks as not implemented
- ‚úÖ **Scope Decision**: Deferred from initial EMIT CHANGES implementation

### Failing Test
```
test_emit_changes_with_tumbling_window_same_window
  Input: 5 records (3 "pending", 2 "completed") in same window
  Expected: 2+ results (one per GROUP BY value)
  Actual: 1 result (all groups merged)
  Status: ‚ùå FAILING (feature not implemented)
```

## üìã Implementation Plan Summary

### 4 Implementation Phases

| Phase | Focus | Effort | Key Tasks |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **1** | GROUP BY Detection | 3-4h | Helper functions, routing, tests |
| **2** | Group Splitting & Agg | 5-6h | Key extraction, buffer split, aggregation |
| **3** | Engine Integration | 2-3h | Return type change, emit multiple results |
| **4** | Testing & Validation | 2-3h | Enable tests, regression, performance |
| **Docs** | Documentation | 1-2h | Update emit-modes, late-data-behavior |
| **TOTAL** | **12-17 hours** | **5 working days** | **20 tasks** |

### Code Changes
- **Files to modify**: 2 (window.rs, engine.rs)
- **Lines of code**: ~200-300 new/modified
- **Code examples provided**: 20+
- **Test cases documented**: 10+

## üéØ Next Steps

### To Start Implementation:

1. **Create new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git checkout -b fr-079-windowed-emit-changes
   ```

2. **Commit analysis documents** (reference material)
   ```bash
   git add docs/feature/FR-079-*.md
   git add docs/feature/fr-079-*.md
   git commit -m "docs: Add FR-079 windowed EMIT CHANGES analysis"
   ```

3. **Start Phase 1** (following FR-079-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)
   - Implement GROUP BY detection helpers
   - Modify window processor routing
   - Add unit tests

4. **Continue through Phases 2-4** systematically
