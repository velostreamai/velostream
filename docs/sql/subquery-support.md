## Supported Subquery Types

| Type | Description | Streaming Context |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Scalar** | Returns a single value | Configuration values, thresholds |
| **EXISTS** | Tests for row existence | Validation, filtering (WHERE and HAVING) |
| **NOT EXISTS** | Tests for non-existence | Exclusion filters (WHERE and HAVING) |
| **IN** | Membership testing | Whitelist/blacklist operations |
| **NOT IN** | Non-membership testing | Exclusion operations |
| **ANY/SOME** | Comparison with any value | Threshold comparisons |
| **ALL** | Comparison with all values | Universal constraints |

## Syntax Reference

### Scalar Subqueries

Returns a single value that can be used in expressions:

```sql
SELECT 
    user_id,
    amount,
    (SELECT max_daily_limit FROM config WHERE type = 'transaction') as daily_limit
FROM transactions;
```

### EXISTS Subqueries

Tests whether a subquery returns any rows:

```sql
SELECT user_id, transaction_amount 
FROM transactions t
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM verified_users v 
    WHERE v.user_id = t.user_id
);
```

### NOT EXISTS Subqueries

Tests whether a subquery returns no rows:

```sql
SELECT user_id, email
FROM users u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM blocked_users b 
    WHERE b.user_id = u.user_id
);
```

### IN Subqueries

Tests membership in a result set:

```sql
SELECT order_id, customer_id, amount
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM premium_customers 
    WHERE status = 'active'
);
```

### NOT IN Subqueries

Tests non-membership in a result set:

```sql
SELECT transaction_id, amount
FROM transactions
WHERE account_id NOT IN (
    SELECT account_id FROM frozen_accounts
);
```

### ANY/SOME Subqueries

Compares with any value in the result set:

```sql
SELECT product_id, price
FROM products
WHERE price > ANY (
    SELECT competitor_price FROM market_data 
    WHERE product_category = 'electronics'
);
```

### ALL Subqueries

Compares with all values in the result set:

```sql
SELECT user_id, credit_score
FROM users
WHERE credit_score >= ALL (
    SELECT minimum_score FROM loan_requirements
);
```

### EXISTS/NOT EXISTS in HAVING Clauses ✅ **NEW**

Filter aggregated groups based on existence checks against other tables:

```sql
-- Volume spike detection in trading with GROUP BY
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as spike_count
FROM market_data
GROUP BY symbol
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM market_data_ts m2
    WHERE m2.symbol = market_data.symbol
    AND m2.volume > 10000
)
AND COUNT(*) >= 5;

-- Volume spike detection in trading with WINDOW
SELECT symbol, volume, event_time,
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY symbol
        ORDER BY event_time
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '5' MINUTE PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as recent_count
FROM market_data_ts
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM market_data_ts m2
    WHERE m2.symbol = market_data_ts.symbol
    AND m2.event_time >= market_data_ts.event_time - INTERVAL '1' MINUTE
    AND m2.volume > 10000
)
AND COUNT(*) >= 5
WINDOW SLIDING(INTERVAL '5' MINUTE, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)
EMIT CHANGES;

-- Customer segmentation with multiple conditions
SELECT customer_tier,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    AVG(lifetime_value) as avg_ltv
FROM customers
GROUP BY customer_tier
HAVING EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM premium_features
    WHERE tier = customer_tier
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM deprecated_tiers
    WHERE name = customer_tier
)
AND COUNT(*) > 100;
```

**Key Features:**
- **Context-Aware Evaluation**: HAVING subqueries have access to both aggregated values and current record
- **Performance Optimized**: Evaluates EXISTS checks efficiently during GROUP BY and WINDOW processing
- **Correlation Support**: Can reference columns from the outer GROUP BY or WINDOW query
- **Multiple Conditions**: Combine EXISTS with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, etc.)
- **WINDOW Support**: Full EXISTS/NOT EXISTS support in HAVING clauses with WINDOW queries

## Examples

### Real-time Fraud Detection

```sql
-- Detect suspicious transactions
SELECT 
    transaction_id,
    user_id,
    amount,
    'SUSPICIOUS' as flag
FROM transactions t
WHERE amount > (
    SELECT avg_amount * 3 
    FROM user_spending_patterns 
    WHERE user_id = t.user_id
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM whitelisted_merchants 
    WHERE merchant_id = t.merchant_id
);
```

### Dynamic Configuration Management

```sql
-- Apply dynamic rate limits
SELECT 
    user_id,
    request_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN request_count > (SELECT rate_limit FROM config WHERE tier = 'premium')
        THEN 'RATE_LIMITED'
        ELSE 'ALLOWED'
    END as status
FROM user_requests ur
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM active_users 
    WHERE subscription_status = 'active'
);
```

### Multi-Stream Correlation

```sql
-- Correlate events across multiple streams
SELECT 
    e.event_id,
    e.user_id,
    e.event_type,
    e.timestamp
FROM events e
WHERE e.user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM login_events 
    WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
)
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM permissions p
    WHERE p.user_id = e.user_id 
    AND p.action = e.event_type
);
```

### Complex Aggregation with Filtering

```sql
-- Revenue analysis with dynamic exclusions
SELECT 
    product_category,
    SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count
FROM sales s
WHERE s.product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id FROM discontinued_products
)
AND s.store_id IN (
    SELECT store_id FROM active_stores 
    WHERE region = 'north_america'
)
AND s.amount >= ALL (
    SELECT minimum_amount FROM pricing_rules 
    WHERE category = s.product_category
)
GROUP BY product_category;
```

### Session-based Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze user sessions with contextual data
SELECT 
    session_id,
    user_id,
    duration_minutes,
    page_views
FROM user_sessions us
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM conversion_events ce
    WHERE ce.session_id = us.session_id
    AND ce.event_type = 'purchase'
)
AND user_id NOT IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM bot_users
);
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Security and Compliance

- **Access Control**: Validate permissions using EXISTS subqueries
- **Fraud Detection**: Compare against known patterns with scalar subqueries
- **Audit Trails**: Exclude unauthorized activities with NOT EXISTS

### 2. Dynamic Configuration

- **Feature Flags**: Use scalar subqueries for dynamic feature enablement
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply limits based on user tiers and current load
- **A/B Testing**: Route users based on experiment configurations

### 3. Real-time Analytics

- **Anomaly Detection**: Compare against historical patterns
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Alert when values exceed dynamic thresholds
- **Correlation Analysis**: Find relationships across multiple streams

### 4. Data Quality

- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity with EXISTS checks
- **Cleansing**: Filter out invalid records with NOT IN
- **Enrichment**: Add contextual data with scalar subqueries

## Performance Considerations

### Streaming Context

In streaming environments, subqueries present unique challenges:

1. **State Management**: Subqueries may require maintaining state across time windows
2. **Memory Usage**: Result sets need careful memory management
3. **Latency**: Complex subqueries can impact real-time processing

### Current Implementation

The implementation provides **production-ready Table SQL subquery execution**:

```rust
// Real implementation via SqlQueryable trait
pub trait SqlQueryable {
    fn sql_scalar(&self, query: &str) -> Result<FieldValue, SqlError>;
    fn sql_exists(&self, where_clause: &str) -> Result<bool, SqlError>;
    fn sql_filter(&self, where_clause: &str) -> Result<Vec<HashMap<String, FieldValue>>, SqlError>;
    fn sql_in(&self, field: &str, values: &[FieldValue]) -> Result<bool, SqlError>;
}

// ProcessorContext provides access to state tables for subquery execution
pub struct ProcessorContext {
    pub state_tables: HashMap<String, Arc<dyn SqlQueryable + Send + Sync>>,
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

Production deployment benefits from:

1. **Direct HashMap Lookups**: O(1) access for scalar subqueries on indexed fields
2. **Early Termination**: EXISTS queries stop at first match
3. **Memory Efficiency**: CompactTable reduces memory usage by 40-60%
4. **Type Safety**: Full integration with FieldValue system eliminates conversion overhead

## Implementation Details

### AST Structure

```rust
pub enum Expr {
    // ... other expressions
    Subquery {
        query: Box<StreamingQuery>,
        subquery_type: SubqueryType,
    },
}

pub enum SubqueryType {
    Scalar,     // (SELECT value)
    Exists,     // EXISTS (SELECT ...)
    NotExists,  // NOT EXISTS (SELECT ...)
    In,         // IN (SELECT ...)
    NotIn,      // NOT IN (SELECT ...)
    Any,        // ANY (SELECT ...)
    All,        // ALL (SELECT ...)
}
```

### Parser Integration

The parser recognizes subquery syntax in multiple contexts:

- **Primary expressions**: `(SELECT ...)` for scalar subqueries
- **EXISTS expressions**: `EXISTS (SELECT ...)` and `NOT EXISTS (SELECT ...)`
- **IN expressions**: Enhanced to support `expr IN (SELECT ...)`

### Execution Engine

The execution engine provides:

- **Real SQL Execution**: Production-ready subquery processing via SqlQueryable trait
- **Type Safety**: Full FieldValue integration with proper type handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for invalid subqueries
- **Table Integration**: Direct access to Table state via ProcessorContext

### Files Modified

2. **`src/velostream/sql/parser.rs`**: Production subquery parsing with complete SQL syntax support
3. **`src/velostream/sql/execution/processors/context.rs`**: ProcessorContext with state_tables for Table access
4. **`src/velostream/table/sql.rs`**: SqlQueryable trait implementation for real subquery execution
5. **`tests/unit/sql/execution/table_sql_test.rs`**: Comprehensive Table SQL integration tests

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Versions

Subquery support is **fully backward compatible**. Existing queries continue to work without changes.

### Adoption Path

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with scalar subqueries for configuration values
2. **Add Validation**: Use EXISTS/NOT EXISTS for data validation
3. **Implement Filtering**: Use IN/NOT IN for dynamic filtering
4. **Advanced Logic**: Leverage ANY/ALL for complex comparisons

### Example Migration

**Before** (workaround without subqueries):
```sql
-- Manual filtering requiring application logic
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_tier = 'premium';
```

**After** (with subqueries):
```sql
-- Dynamic filtering based on current criteria
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM customers 
    WHERE tier = 'premium' 
    AND status = 'active'
    AND last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAYS
);
```
