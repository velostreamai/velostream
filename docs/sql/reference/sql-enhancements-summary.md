# SQL Enhancements Summary - Advanced SQL Features

## 🎯 Overview

This document summarizes the major enhancements made to the FerrisStreams SQL execution engine, including advanced conditional logic, temporal arithmetic, and comprehensive function support for real-world analytics use cases.

## ✅ Newly Implemented SQL Functions

### 1. DATEDIFF Function ⏱️

**Purpose**: Calculate time differences between dates in various units

**Syntax**: `DATEDIFF(unit, start_date, end_date)`

**Supported Units**: 
- `'milliseconds'`, `'ms'`
- `'seconds'`, `'second'`
- `'minutes'`, `'minute'`
- `'hours'`, `'hour'`
- `'days'`, `'day'`

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Calculate hours since order creation
SELECT order_id, DATEDIFF('hours', created_at, NOW()) as hours_old
FROM orders;

-- IoT sensor battery monitoring
SELECT device_id,
       DATEDIFF('hours', last_charge_time, TIMESTAMP()) as hours_since_charge,
       CASE 
         WHEN DATEDIFF('hours', last_charge_time, TIMESTAMP()) > 24 THEN 'LOW_BATTERY'
         ELSE 'NORMAL'
       END as battery_status
FROM iot_sensors;
```

**Use Cases**: IoT monitoring, social media analytics, time-based filtering

### 2. POSITION Function 🔍

**Purpose**: Find the position of a substring within a string

**Syntax**: `POSITION(substring, string[, start_position])`

**Features**:
- 1-based indexing (SQL standard)
- Optional start position for searching from a specific location
- Returns 0 if substring not found
- Unicode-safe string processing

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Extract hashtags from social media content
SELECT post_id,
       POSITION('#', content) as hashtag_start,
       SUBSTRING(content, POSITION('#', content), 
                 POSITION(' ', content, POSITION('#', content)) - POSITION('#', content)) as hashtag
FROM social_posts
WHERE POSITION('#', content) > 0;

-- Find email domains
SELECT customer_id,
       email,
       SUBSTRING(email, POSITION('@', email) + 1) as email_domain
FROM customers
WHERE POSITION('@', email) > 0;
```

**Use Cases**: Social media hashtag extraction, email processing, text parsing

### 3. LISTAGG Aggregate Function 📝

**Purpose**: Concatenate values from multiple rows with a delimiter

**Syntax**: `LISTAGG(expression, delimiter)` or `LISTAGG(DISTINCT expression, delimiter)`

**Features**:
- String aggregation with custom delimiters
- Support for DISTINCT values
- Works with arrays or individual values

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Aggregate purchased products per customer
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*) as order_count,
       LISTAGG(product_name, ', ') as purchased_products,
       LISTAGG(DISTINCT category, '; ') as product_categories
FROM order_items
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Crisis monitoring with location aggregation
SELECT crisis_type,
       COUNT(*) as mention_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_reporters,
       LISTAGG(DISTINCT location, ', ') as affected_locations
FROM crisis_reports
GROUP BY crisis_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50;
```

**Use Cases**: Crisis monitoring, customer analytics, data summarization

### 4. HAVING Clause Support 🔄

**Purpose**: Post-aggregation filtering (filter results after GROUP BY)

**Syntax**: Standard SQL HAVING clause after GROUP BY

**Features**:
- Filters aggregated results
- Supports complex expressions with aggregate functions
- Evaluates after field selection and aggregation

**Examples**:
```sql
-- Filter high-activity customers
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*) as order_count,
       SUM(amount) as total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 AND SUM(amount) > 1000;

-- Trending hashtags with minimum activity threshold
SELECT hashtag,
       COUNT(*) as mention_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM hashtag_mentions
GROUP BY hashtag
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;

-- High-value influencer activity
SELECT user_id, username, follower_count,
       COUNT(*) as post_count
FROM social_posts
WHERE follower_count > 10000
GROUP BY user_id, username, follower_count
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

**Use Cases**: Social media trending analysis, customer segmentation, analytics filtering

## 📊 Impact on Demo Compatibility
