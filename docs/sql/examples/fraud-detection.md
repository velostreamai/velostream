Copy-paste SQL queries for detecting fraudulent activities and suspicious patterns in real-time.

> **⚠️ Important**: All examples include required CREATE STREAM statements. These queries are ready to run in FerrisStreams.

## Transaction-Based Fraud Detection

### High-Risk Transaction Patterns

```sql
-- Data source: incoming transactions
CREATE STREAM transactions WITH (
    topic = 'transactions-topic',
    bootstrap.servers = 'localhost:9092',
    value.deserializer = 'json'
);

-- Data sink: flagged transactions
CREATE STREAM fraud_alerts WITH (
    topic = 'fraud-alerts-topic',
    bootstrap.servers = 'localhost:9092',
    value.serializer = 'json'
);

-- Detect suspicious transaction patterns
INSERT INTO fraud_alerts
SELECT
    transaction_id,
    customer_id,
    amount,
    merchant_location,
    transaction_timestamp,
    -- Risk factors
    CASE WHEN amount > 5000 THEN 'LARGE_AMOUNT' END as large_amount_flag,
    CASE WHEN merchant_location != customer_home_country THEN 'FOREIGN_TRANSACTION' END as foreign_flag,
    CASE WHEN EXTRACT('HOUR', transaction_timestamp) BETWEEN 2 AND 5 THEN 'UNUSUAL_TIME' END as time_flag,
    -- Velocity checks
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as transactions_last_hour,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '24' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as amount_last_24h,
    -- Risk score calculation
    (CASE WHEN amount > 5000 THEN 30 ELSE 0 END +
     CASE WHEN merchant_location != customer_home_country THEN 20 ELSE 0 END +
     CASE WHEN EXTRACT('HOUR', transaction_timestamp) BETWEEN 2 AND 5 THEN 15 ELSE 0 END) as risk_score
FROM transactions t
JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE transaction_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR;
```

### Unusual Spending Patterns

```sql
-- Detect spending anomalies compared to customer history
SELECT
    customer_id,
    transaction_id,
    amount,
    merchant_category,
    -- Customer's historical patterns
    AVG(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
        ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
    ) as avg_amount_30_days,
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id, merchant_category
        ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
    ) as previous_transactions_in_category,
    -- Anomaly detection
    CASE
        WHEN amount > 5 * AVG(amount) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
            ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
        ) THEN 'UNUSUALLY_LARGE'
        WHEN COUNT(*) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id, merchant_category
            ORDER BY transaction_timestamp
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING
        ) = 0 THEN 'NEW_MERCHANT_CATEGORY'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as spending_anomaly
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAYS;
```

## Account Takeover Detection

### Suspicious Login Patterns

```sql
-- Detect account takeover attempts
SELECT
    user_id,
    login_timestamp,
    ip_address,
    user_agent,
    location_country,
    -- Previous login comparison
    LAG(ip_address, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_timestamp) as prev_ip,
    LAG(location_country, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_timestamp) as prev_country,
    LAG(login_timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_timestamp) as prev_login,
    -- Geographic velocity (impossible travel)
    CASE
        WHEN LAG(location_country, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_timestamp) != location_country
         AND DATEDIFF('minutes',
             LAG(login_timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_timestamp),
             login_timestamp
         ) < 120  -- Less than 2 hours between different countries
        THEN 'IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as travel_anomaly,
    -- Login frequency
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY login_timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as logins_last_hour,
    -- Device consistency
    CASE
        WHEN user_agent != LAG(user_agent, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_timestamp)
        THEN 'NEW_DEVICE'
        ELSE 'KNOWN_DEVICE'
    END as device_consistency
FROM user_logins
WHERE login_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24' HOURS;
```

### Failed Authentication Analysis

```sql
-- Brute force and credential stuffing detection
SELECT
    ip_address,
    user_id,
    login_timestamp,
    success_flag,
    -- Count failed attempts
    COUNT(CASE WHEN success_flag = false THEN 1 END) OVER (
        PARTITION BY ip_address
        ORDER BY login_timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as failed_attempts_from_ip_1h,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN success_flag = false THEN 1 END) OVER (
        PARTITION BY user_id
        ORDER BY login_timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as failed_attempts_for_user_1h,
    -- Distinct users from same IP
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) OVER (
        PARTITION BY ip_address
        ORDER BY login_timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as unique_users_from_ip,
    -- Attack classification
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN success_flag = false THEN 1 END) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ip_address
            ORDER BY login_timestamp
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) > 50 THEN 'BRUTE_FORCE_ATTACK'
        WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) OVER (
            PARTITION BY ip_address
            ORDER BY login_timestamp
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) > 20 THEN 'CREDENTIAL_STUFFING'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as attack_type
FROM login_attempts
WHERE login_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '6' HOURS;
```

## Payment Fraud Detection

    MAX(amount) as max_amount,
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount,
    MIN(transaction_timestamp) as first_transaction,
    MAX(transaction_timestamp) as last_transaction,
    DATEDIFF('minutes', MIN(transaction_timestamp), MAX(transaction_timestamp)) as time_span_minutes,
    -- Card testing indicators
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) >= 5
         AND MAX(amount) < 10
         AND DATEDIFF('minutes', MIN(transaction_timestamp), MAX(transaction_timestamp)) < 60
        THEN 'CARD_TESTING_SUSPECTED'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as fraud_indicator
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '2' HOURS
  AND amount < 50  -- Focus on small amounts
GROUP BY customer_id, payment_method_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY small_transactions_count DESC;
```

### Chargeback Risk Assessment

```sql
-- Identify high chargeback risk transactions
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    t.customer_id,
    t.amount,
    t.merchant_category,
    c.account_age_days,
    c.previous_chargebacks,
    -- Risk factors
    CASE WHEN c.account_age_days < 30 THEN 'NEW_ACCOUNT' END as new_account_flag,
    CASE WHEN c.previous_chargebacks > 0 THEN 'CHARGEBACK_HISTORY' END as chargeback_history_flag,
    CASE WHEN t.amount > c.avg_transaction_amount * 3 THEN 'UNUSUAL_AMOUNT' END as amount_flag,
    -- Merchant risk
    m.chargeback_rate as merchant_chargeback_rate,
    CASE WHEN m.chargeback_rate > 0.05 THEN 'HIGH_RISK_MERCHANT' END as merchant_risk_flag,
    -- Overall risk score
    (CASE WHEN c.account_age_days < 30 THEN 25 ELSE 0 END +
     CASE WHEN c.previous_chargebacks > 0 THEN 30 ELSE 0 END +
     CASE WHEN t.amount > c.avg_transaction_amount * 3 THEN 20 ELSE 0 END +
     CASE WHEN m.chargeback_rate > 0.05 THEN 20 ELSE 0 END) as chargeback_risk_score
FROM transactions t
JOIN customer_risk_profile c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN merchant_risk_profile m ON t.merchant_id = m.merchant_id
WHERE t.transaction_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR;

    -- Abuse patterns
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) > (SELECT max_uses_per_customer FROM promo_codes WHERE code = p.promo_code)
        THEN 'EXCEEDED_USAGE_LIMIT'
        WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT ip_address) = 1 AND COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) > 10
        THEN 'MULTIPLE_ACCOUNTS_SAME_IP'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as abuse_pattern
FROM promo_usage p
