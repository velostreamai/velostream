## Performance Tips

1. **Use time-based partitioning** for market data tables
2. **Index on symbol + timestamp** for efficient time series queries
3. **Consider materialized views** for complex moving averages
4. **Use appropriate data types** for financial precision
5. **Implement data retention policies** for historical data

## Common Patterns

```sql
-- Pattern: Price Change Detection
CASE
    WHEN current_price > prev_price * 1.05 THEN 'SIGNIFICANT_UP'
    WHEN current_price < prev_price * 0.95 THEN 'SIGNIFICANT_DOWN'
    ELSE 'NORMAL'
END as price_movement;

-- Pattern: Volume Spike Detection
CASE
    WHEN volume > avg_volume * 2 THEN 'VOLUME_SPIKE'
    ELSE 'NORMAL_VOLUME'
END as volume_alert;

-- Pattern: Risk Level Classification
CASE
    WHEN position_risk_pct > 10 THEN 'HIGH_RISK'
    WHEN position_risk_pct > 5 THEN 'MEDIUM_RISK'
    ELSE 'LOW_RISK'
END as risk_level;
```
