## Performance Tips

### Efficient Mathematical Operations

```sql
-- ✅ Good: Use simple operations when possible
SELECT amount * 2 FROM orders;  -- Faster than POWER(amount, 2) for squaring

-- ✅ Good: Pre-calculate constants
SELECT
    amount,
    amount * 1.08 as amount_with_tax  -- Pre-calculated tax multiplier
FROM orders;

-- ⚠️ Careful: Complex mathematical operations on large datasets
SELECT POWER(SQRT(ABS(amount)), 3) FROM large_table;  -- Consider pre-processing
```

### Precision Considerations

```sql
-- Handle division by zero
SELECT
    numerator,
    denominator,
    CASE
        WHEN denominator = 0 THEN NULL
        ELSE ROUND(numerator / denominator, 4)
    END as safe_division
FROM calculations;

-- Maintain precision in financial calculations
SELECT
    order_amount,
    ROUND(order_amount * 0.08, 2) as tax_amount,  -- Always round money to 2 decimals
    ROUND(order_amount * 1.08, 2) as total_with_tax
FROM orders;
```

## Common Patterns

### Bucketing and Binning

```sql
-- Create value buckets
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_spent,
    FLOOR(total_spent / 1000) * 1000 as spending_bucket,
    CASE
        WHEN total_spent < 100 THEN 'Low Spender'
        WHEN total_spent < 500 THEN 'Medium Spender'
        ELSE 'High Spender'
    END as spending_category
FROM customer_totals;
```

### Normalization

```sql
-- Normalize values to 0-100 scale
SELECT
    product_id,
    rating,
    min_rating,
    max_rating,
    ROUND(
        (rating - min_rating) * 100.0 / (max_rating - min_rating),
        1
    ) as normalized_rating_0_100
FROM product_ratings
CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT MIN(rating) as min_rating, MAX(rating) as max_rating
    FROM product_ratings
) rating_bounds;
```

### Ranking and Scoring

```sql
-- Calculate weighted scores
SELECT
    candidate_id,
    technical_score,
    communication_score,
    experience_score,
    ROUND(
        technical_score * 0.5 +
        communication_score * 0.3 +
        experience_score * 0.2,
        2
    ) as weighted_total_score
FROM interview_scores;
```

## Mathematical Constants

While not built-in functions, you can use these common constants:

```sql
-- Common mathematical constants
SELECT
    radius,
    2 * 3.14159 * radius as circumference,  -- π ≈ 3.14159
    3.14159 * POWER(radius, 2) as area,     -- π * r²
