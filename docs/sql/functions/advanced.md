## Null Handling Functions

### COALESCE - First Non-Null Value

```sql
-- Provide defaults for missing data
SELECT
    customer_id,
    COALESCE(preferred_name, first_name, 'Unknown Customer') as display_name,
    COALESCE(mobile_phone, home_phone, work_phone, 'No phone') as contact_phone,
    COALESCE(email, 'no-email@unknown.com') as contact_email
FROM customers;

-- Chain multiple fallback values
SELECT
    product_id,
    COALESCE(sale_price, list_price, msrp, 0.00) as display_price,
    COALESCE(short_description, long_description, product_name, 'No description') as description
FROM products;
```

### NULLIF - Return NULL if Values Equal

```sql
-- Convert zero values to NULL for calculations
SELECT
    order_id,
    discount_rate,
    NULLIF(discount_rate, 0.0) as effective_discount,  -- NULL if 0
    amount / NULLIF(discount_rate, 0.0) as undiscounted_amount
FROM orders;

-- Prevent division by zero
SELECT
    product_id,
    total_views,
    total_clicks,
    total_clicks * 100.0 / NULLIF(total_views, 0) as click_through_rate
FROM marketing_metrics;
```

### ISNULL and IS NOT NULL - Null Checking

```sql
-- Filter based on null status
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
  AND phone IS NOT NULL
  AND preferred_name IS NULL;

-- Count null vs non-null values
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(email) as with_email,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(email) as without_email,
    COUNT(phone) as with_phone,
    COUNT(address) as with_address
FROM customers;
```

## Conditional Logic

### CASE WHEN - Conditional Expressions

```sql
-- Simple case expressions
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_orders,
    CASE
        WHEN total_orders >= 50 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN total_orders >= 20 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN total_orders >= 5 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'New'
    END as customer_tier
FROM customer_summary;

-- Complex conditional logic
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    status,
    CASE
        WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 'No Revenue'
        WHEN status = 'pending' AND DATEDIFF('days', order_date, NOW()) > 7 THEN 'At Risk'
        WHEN status = 'completed' AND amount > 1000 THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 'Standard'
        ELSE 'Unknown Status'
    END as order_category,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT('DOW', order_date) IN (0, 6) THEN 'Weekend'
        WHEN EXTRACT('HOUR', order_date) BETWEEN 9 AND 17 THEN 'Business Hours'
        ELSE 'After Hours'
    END as order_timing
FROM orders;
```

### Searched CASE vs Simple CASE

```sql
-- Searched CASE (more flexible)
SELECT
    product_id,
    CASE
        WHEN price > 1000 AND category = 'electronics' THEN 'Premium Electronics'
        WHEN price > 500 THEN 'Mid-Range'
        WHEN price > 100 THEN 'Budget'
        ELSE 'Economy'
    END as price_tier
FROM products;

-- Simple CASE (for exact matches)
SELECT
    order_id,
    status,
    CASE status
        WHEN 'pending' THEN 'Awaiting Processing'
        WHEN 'shipped' THEN 'In Transit'
        WHEN 'delivered' THEN 'Complete'
        WHEN 'cancelled' THEN 'Cancelled'
        ELSE 'Unknown Status'
    END as status_description
FROM orders;
```

## Timestamp and Processing Functions

### TIMESTAMP() - Processing Timestamp

```sql
-- Add processing timestamps to records
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    amount,
    TIMESTAMP() as processed_at,
    DATEDIFF('milliseconds', order_timestamp, TIMESTAMP()) as processing_delay_ms
FROM orders;

-- Track processing pipeline stages
SELECT
    event_id,
    event_data,
    TIMESTAMP() as enrichment_timestamp,
    'enriched_with_customer_data' as processing_stage
FROM events
JOIN customers ON JSON_VALUE(event_data, '$.user_id') = customers.customer_id;
```

## Type Conversion Functions

### CAST - Type Conversion

```sql
-- Convert between data types
SELECT
    order_id,
    CAST(order_id AS VARCHAR) as order_id_string,
    CAST(amount AS INTEGER) as amount_rounded,
    CAST(order_date AS VARCHAR) as order_date_string,
    CAST('123.45' AS FLOAT) as parsed_number
FROM orders;

-- Safe type conversion with error handling
SELECT
    user_input,
    CASE
        WHEN user_input ~ '^[0-9]+$' THEN CAST(user_input AS INTEGER)
        ELSE NULL
    END as parsed_integer,
    CASE
        WHEN user_input ~ '^[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?$' THEN CAST(user_input AS FLOAT)
        ELSE NULL
    END as parsed_float
FROM user_form_data;
```

## Advanced String and Pattern Functions

### REGEXP - Regular Expression Matching

```sql
-- Pattern validation
SELECT
    customer_id,
    email,
    phone,
    CASE
        WHEN email ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$' THEN 'Valid Email'
        ELSE 'Invalid Email'
    END as email_validation,
    CASE
        WHEN phone ~ '^\\+?1?[0-9]{10}$' THEN 'Valid Phone'
        ELSE 'Invalid Phone'
    END as phone_validation
FROM customers;

-- Extract patterns from text
SELECT
    log_entry,
    CASE
        WHEN log_entry ~ '\\bERROR\\b' THEN 'Error'
        WHEN log_entry ~ '\\bWARN(ING)?\\b' THEN 'Warning'
        WHEN log_entry ~ '\\bINFO\\b' THEN 'Info'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END as log_level
FROM application_logs;
```

### LPAD and RPAD - String Padding

```sql
-- Pad strings to fixed width
SELECT
    order_id,
    LPAD(CAST(order_id AS VARCHAR), 8, '0') as padded_order_id,
    RPAD(customer_name, 20, ' ') as formatted_name,
    LPAD('$' || CAST(amount AS VARCHAR), 10, ' ') as formatted_amount
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

-- Create fixed-width reports
SELECT
    RPAD(product_name, 30, '.') as product_name_padded,
    LPAD(CAST(ROUND(price, 2) AS VARCHAR), 8, ' ') as price_padded,
    LPAD(CAST(inventory_count AS VARCHAR), 6, ' ') as inventory_padded
FROM products
ORDER BY product_name;
```

## Set and Range Operations

### IN and NOT IN - Set Membership

```sql
-- Filter using set membership
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped')
  AND customer_tier IN ('premium', 'vip')
  AND product_id NOT IN (1001, 1002, 1003);  -- Exclude test products

-- Dynamic set filtering
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE category IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT category
    FROM best_selling_products
    WHERE sales_rank <= 10
);
```

### BETWEEN - Range Operations

```sql
-- Numeric and date ranges
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE amount BETWEEN 100 AND 500
  AND order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
  AND EXTRACT('HOUR', order_timestamp) BETWEEN 9 AND 17;

-- Character ranges (alphabetical)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE UPPER(last_name) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M'
ORDER BY last_name;
```

## Advanced Analytical Functions

### GREATEST and LEAST - Min/Max of Values

```sql
-- Find maximum/minimum across columns
SELECT
    product_id,
    online_price,
    store_price,
    wholesale_price,
    GREATEST(online_price, store_price, wholesale_price) as highest_price,
    LEAST(online_price, store_price, wholesale_price) as lowest_price,
    GREATEST(online_price, store_price, wholesale_price) -
    LEAST(online_price, store_price, wholesale_price) as price_range
FROM product_pricing;

-- Safe division with bounds
SELECT
    order_id,
    total_amount,
    discount_amount,
    LEAST(discount_amount, total_amount) as applied_discount,  -- Can't discount more than total
    GREATEST(total_amount - discount_amount, 0) as final_amount  -- Can't go below zero
FROM orders;
```

## Real-World Advanced Function Examples

### Data Quality Scoring

```sql
-- Calculate comprehensive data quality scores
SELECT
    customer_id,
    -- Completeness score (0-100)
