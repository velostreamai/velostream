# Window Functions

Complete reference for window functions in FerrisStreams. These functions perform calculations across rows related to the current row using OVER clauses, essential for ranking, running totals, and comparative analysis.

## Ranking Functions

### ROW_NUMBER() - Sequential Numbering

```sql
-- Assign unique sequence numbers within partitions
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as order_sequence
FROM orders;

-- Number all records globally
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    price,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY price DESC) as price_rank_global
FROM products;
```

### RANK() - Ranking with Gaps

```sql
-- Rank with gaps for tied values
SELECT
    student_id,
    test_score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY test_score DESC) as score_rank
FROM test_results;
-- If two students tie for 2nd place, next rank is 4th (gap created)

-- Rank within categories
SELECT
    product_id,
    category,
    sales_amount,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY sales_amount DESC) as category_rank
FROM product_sales;
```

### DENSE_RANK() - Ranking without Gaps

```sql
-- Rank without gaps for tied values
SELECT
    employee_id,
    performance_score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY performance_score DESC) as rank_with_gaps,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY performance_score DESC) as rank_no_gaps
FROM employee_reviews;
-- If two employees tie for 2nd place, next rank is 3rd (no gap)
```

### PERCENT_RANK() - Percentile Ranking

```sql
-- Calculate percentile rankings
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_spent,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) as spending_percentile,
    CASE
        WHEN PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) >= 0.9 THEN 'Top 10%'
        WHEN PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) >= 0.5 THEN 'Top 50%'
        ELSE 'Bottom 50%'
    END as spending_tier
FROM customer_totals;
```

## Value Access Functions

### LAG() - Access Previous Row Values

```sql
-- Compare with previous values
SELECT
    order_date,
    daily_sales,
    LAG(daily_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as previous_day_sales,
    daily_sales - LAG(daily_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as daily_change,
    ROUND(
        (daily_sales - LAG(daily_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date)) * 100.0 /
        LAG(daily_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date),
        2
    ) as daily_change_pct
FROM daily_sales_summary
ORDER BY order_date;

-- Compare with values from N periods ago
SELECT
    month,
    revenue,
    LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month,
    LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY month) as same_month_last_year,
    revenue - LAG(revenue, 12) OVER (ORDER BY month) as year_over_year_change
FROM monthly_revenue;
```

### LEAD() - Access Following Row Values

```sql
-- Look ahead to future values (limited in streaming contexts)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    LEAD(amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as next_order_amount,
    LEAD(order_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as next_order_date
FROM orders;

-- Forward-looking analysis
SELECT
    date,
    stock_price,
    LEAD(stock_price, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) as next_day_price,
    CASE
        WHEN LEAD(stock_price, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) > stock_price THEN 'Will Rise'
        WHEN LEAD(stock_price, 1) OVER (ORDER BY date) < stock_price THEN 'Will Fall'
        ELSE 'Will Stay Same'
    END as next_day_direction
FROM stock_prices;
```

### FIRST_VALUE() and LAST_VALUE() - Boundary Values

```sql
-- Access first and last values in partitions
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    FIRST_VALUE(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as first_order_amount,
    LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as latest_order_amount
FROM orders;

-- Track high and low values within periods
SELECT
    trading_date,
    symbol,
    price,
    FIRST_VALUE(price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY symbol, DATE_FORMAT(trading_date, '%Y-%m')
        ORDER BY price ASC
    ) as monthly_low,
    FIRST_VALUE(price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY symbol, DATE_FORMAT(trading_date, '%Y-%m')
        ORDER BY price DESC
    ) as monthly_high
FROM stock_trades;
```

### NTH_VALUE() - Access Nth Value

```sql
-- Access specific positioned values
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    NTH_VALUE(amount, 2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as second_order_amount,
    NTH_VALUE(amount, 3) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as third_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

## Distribution Functions

### CUME_DIST() - Cumulative Distribution

```sql
-- Calculate cumulative distribution
SELECT
    product_id,
    price,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY price) as price_cumulative_dist,
    ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY price) * 100, 1) as price_percentile
FROM products
ORDER BY price;
```

### NTILE() - Divide into Buckets

```sql
-- Divide customers into quartiles
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_spent,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) as spending_quartile,
    CASE NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent)
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Low Spenders'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Medium Spenders'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'High Spenders'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'VIP Customers'
    END as customer_segment
FROM customer_totals;

-- Create deciles for detailed analysis
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as salary_decile
FROM employees;
```

## Window Frames

### ROWS BETWEEN - Physical Row Boundaries

```sql
-- Running totals
SELECT
    order_date,
    daily_revenue,
    SUM(daily_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as cumulative_revenue
FROM daily_revenue;

-- Moving averages
SELECT
    date,
    temperature,
    AVG(temperature) OVER (
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as seven_day_avg_temp
FROM weather_data;

-- Forward and backward windows
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
    ) as three_order_total
FROM orders;
```

### RANGE BETWEEN - Value-Based Boundaries

```sql
-- Time-based ranges
SELECT
    order_date,
    amount,
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date
        RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as orders_up_to_date,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date
        RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) as remaining_revenue
FROM orders;
```

## Advanced Window Function Patterns

### Multiple Window Specifications

```sql
-- Use different window specifications in one query
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    -- Global ranking
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as global_rank,
    -- Customer-specific ranking
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as customer_order_seq,
    -- Running customer total
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as customer_running_total,
    -- Moving average of last 3 orders per customer
    AVG(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as customer_3_order_avg
FROM orders;
```

### Window Function with Filtering

```sql
-- Conditional window functions
SELECT
    product_id,
    sale_date,
    quantity,
    -- Rank only among profitable sales
    CASE
        WHEN profit > 0 THEN
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY profit DESC)
        ELSE NULL
    END as profitable_sale_rank,
    -- Running total of successful sales only
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_id
        ORDER BY sale_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as completed_quantity_total
FROM sales;
```

## Real-World Examples

    -- Year-to-date cumulative sales
    SUM(monthly_sales) OVER (
        PARTITION BY salesperson_id
        ORDER BY sale_month
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING

        PARTITION BY salesperson_id
        ORDER BY sale_month
    ) as month_over_month_change,

    -- Days since previous order
    order_date - LAG(order_date, 1) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
    ) as days_since_last_order,
    -- Running lifetime value
    SUM(order_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as lifetime_value,
    -- Average order value (last 5 orders)
    AVG(order_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as recent_avg_order_value,
    -- First and most recent order amounts
    FIRST_VALUE(order_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date
    ) as first_order_amount,
    LAST_VALUE(order_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id

        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as current_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

    closing_price,
    -- Simple moving averages
    AVG(closing_price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY symbol
        ORDER BY trade_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as sma_20,
    AVG(closing_price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY symbol
        ORDER BY trade_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 49 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

        (closing_price - LAG(closing_price, 1) OVER (
            PARTITION BY symbol
            ORDER BY trade_date
        )) * 100.0 / LAG(closing_price, 1) OVER (
            PARTITION BY symbol

SELECT
    product_id,
    date,
    stock_level,
    daily_sales,
    -- Days of inventory remaining (simple calculation)
    CASE
        WHEN daily_sales > 0 THEN stock_level / daily_sales
        ELSE NULL
    END as days_of_inventory,
    -- Inventory trend (increasing/decreasing)
    stock_level - LAG(stock_level, 1) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_id
        ORDER BY date
    ) as daily_stock_change,
    -- Average sales over last 7 days
    AVG(daily_sales) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_id
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as avg_sales_7_days,
    -- Stock rank among all products
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY date ORDER BY stock_level DESC) as stock_level_rank,

    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY date ORDER BY daily_sales DESC) as sales_velocity_rank
FROM inventory_daily;
```

## Performance Tips

### Efficient Window Function Usage

```sql
-- ✅ Good: Use single OVER clause for multiple functions
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_amount,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY order_amount DESC) as amount_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY order_amount DESC) as amount_dense_rank
FROM orders;

-- ✅ Good: Use window aliases for complex windows
SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER customer_window as running_total,
    AVG(amount) OVER customer_window as running_average
FROM orders
WINDOW customer_window AS (
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
);
```

### Memory Considerations

```sql
-- ⚠️ Be careful with large window frames
SELECT
    *,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW  -- Can use lots of memory
    ) as running_total
FROM large_orders_table;

-- ✅ Better: Use limited window frames when possible
SELECT
    *,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 999 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW  -- Limited to last 1000 rows
    ) as rolling_1000_total
FROM large_orders_table;
```
