# Aggregate Streaming Data

Learn how to calculate totals, averages, counts and other aggregate functions with GROUP BY operations in streaming data.

> **⚠️ Important**: All queries require CREATE STREAM statements with WITH clauses for data sources and sinks.

## Basic Grouping

### Count Records per Group
```sql
-- Define data source and sink
CREATE STREAM orders WITH (
    topic = 'orders-topic',
    bootstrap.servers = 'localhost:9092',
    value.deserializer = 'json'
);

CREATE STREAM customer_order_counts WITH (
    topic = 'customer-counts-topic',
    bootstrap.servers = 'localhost:9092',
    value.serializer = 'json'
);

-- Count orders per customer
INSERT INTO customer_order_counts
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### Multiple Aggregates
```sql
-- Data sources
CREATE STREAM transactions WITH (
    config_file = 'configs/transactions-source.yaml'
);

CREATE STREAM category_stats WITH (
    config_file = 'configs/category-stats-sink.yaml'
);

-- Multiple aggregation functions in one query
INSERT INTO category_stats
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total,
    AVG(amount) as average,
    MIN(amount) as minimum,
    MAX(amount) as maximum
FROM transactions
GROUP BY category;
```

## Multiple Column Grouping

```sql
-- Data sources
CREATE STREAM orders WITH (
    config_file = 'configs/orders-source.yaml'
);

CREATE STREAM customer_status_summary WITH (
    config_file = 'configs/customer-status-sink.yaml'
);

-- Group by customer and status
INSERT INTO customer_status_summary
SELECT customer_id, order_status, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(amount) as total
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, order_status;
```

**This creates separate groups for each unique combination:**
- Customer 1, Status 'pending'
- Customer 1, Status 'completed'
- Customer 2, Status 'pending'
- etc.

## Expression-Based Grouping

### Time-Based Grouping
```sql
-- Data sources
CREATE STREAM orders WITH (
    topic = 'orders-topic',
    bootstrap.servers = 'localhost:9092',
    value.deserializer = 'json'
);

CREATE STREAM monthly_summary WITH (
    topic = 'monthly-summary-topic',
    bootstrap.servers = 'localhost:9092',
    value.serializer = 'json'
);

-- Group by year and month
INSERT INTO monthly_summary
SELECT
    YEAR(order_date) as year,
    MONTH(order_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as monthly_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date);
```

### Category-Based Grouping
```sql
-- Group by price range
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN amount < 50 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN amount < 200 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END as price_range,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY
    CASE
        WHEN amount < 50 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN amount < 200 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END;
```

## HAVING Clause - Filter Grouped Results

Use HAVING to filter groups based on aggregate conditions (after GROUP BY):

```sql
-- High-value customers only (spent more than $1000)
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 1000;
```

```sql
-- Complex HAVING conditions
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*) as order_count,
       SUM(amount) as total_spent,
       AVG(amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01'  -- Filter before grouping
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING (COUNT(*) > 5 AND SUM(amount) > 1000.0)
    OR (COUNT(*) > 10 AND AVG(amount) > 100.0)
    OR SUM(amount) > 5000.0;  -- Filter after grouping
```

### HAVING vs WHERE
- **WHERE**: Filters individual rows BEFORE grouping
- **HAVING**: Filters groups AFTER aggregation

```sql
SELECT product_category, brand,
       COUNT(*) as sales_count,
       SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
       AVG(amount) as avg_sale_amount
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'        -- Filter rows before grouping
  AND amount > 0                       -- Only positive amounts
GROUP BY product_category, brand
HAVING (COUNT(*) >= 50 AND SUM(amount) >= 10000.0)  -- Filter groups after aggregation
    OR (brand = 'Premium' AND COUNT(*) >= 20)
    OR AVG(amount) > 200.0;
```

## Real-World Aggregation Examples

### Customer Analytics
```sql
-- Customer spending analysis
SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    SUM(amount) as lifetime_value,
    AVG(amount) as avg_order_value,
    MIN(order_date) as first_order,
    MAX(order_date) as last_order,
    COUNT_DISTINCT(product_category) as categories_purchased
FROM orders
WHERE order_status = 'completed'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3  -- Customers with 3+ orders only
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;
```

### Product Performance
```sql
-- Top-performing products by category
SELECT
    category,
    product_name,
    COUNT(*) as times_sold,
    SUM(quantity) as total_quantity,
    SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(amount) as avg_price
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY category, product_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10  -- Products sold at least 10 times
ORDER BY category, total_revenue DESC;
```

### Time-Based Analytics
```sql
-- Monthly sales trends
SELECT
    YEAR(order_date) as year,
    MONTH(order_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    COUNT_DISTINCT(customer_id) as unique_customers,
    SUM(amount) as monthly_revenue,
    AVG(amount) as avg_order_value,
    STDDEV(amount) as revenue_volatility
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### Statistical Analysis
```sql
-- Product pricing statistics by category
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as product_count,
    AVG(price) as avg_price,
    MIN(price) as min_price,
    MAX(price) as max_price,
    STDDEV(price) as price_std_dev,
    VARIANCE(price) as price_variance,
    STRING_AGG(brand, ', ') as available_brands
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5  -- Categories with at least 5 products
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

## Common Aggregation Patterns

### Ranking and Top N
```sql
-- Top 10 customers by spending
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Percentage Calculations
```sql
-- Category contribution to total sales
SELECT
    category,
    SUM(amount) as category_total,
    SUM(amount) * 100.0 / (
        SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders
    ) as percentage_of_total
FROM orders
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY percentage_of_total DESC;
```

### Conditional Aggregation
```sql
-- Count orders by status within each customer
SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as pending_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as cancelled_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use indexes on GROUP BY columns** for better performance
2. **Filter with WHERE before GROUP BY** when possible
3. **LIMIT results** when you don't need all groups
4. **Use DISTINCT carefully** - it's expensive for large datasets
5. **Consider streaming vs batch** for time-sensitive aggregations
