| Window Function Type | Records | Time (ms) | Avg per Record (µs) | **Throughput (msgs/sec)** |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY amount)` | 1,000 | 15.21 | 15.211 | **65,745** |
| `LAG(amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY amount)` | 1,000 | 13.39 | 13.39 | **74,683** |
| `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id)` | - | - | - | **Not Supported** |

## Performance Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **Simple SELECT operations** achieve the highest throughput:
   - Filtered queries with selective WHERE clauses: ~80,000-90,000 msgs/sec
   - Basic projection queries: ~80,000 msgs/sec  
   - Full table scans: ~50,000 msgs/sec

2. **GROUP BY aggregations** show moderate throughput:
   - Simple aggregations: 5,000-12,000 msgs/sec
   - Performance varies by aggregation complexity
   - Multiple aggregate functions in single query perform well

3. **Window functions** maintain good performance:
   - Analytical functions: 65,000-75,000 msgs/sec
   - Performance close to simple SELECT operations
   - Some window aggregations not yet implemented

### Throughput Patterns

- **Highest Throughput**: Filtered SELECT queries (80K+ msgs/sec)
- **Medium Throughput**: Window functions (65K-75K msgs/sec), Basic SELECTs (50K-80K msgs/sec)  
- **Lower Throughput**: GROUP BY aggregations (5K-12K msgs/sec)

The performance difference between SELECT and GROUP BY operations reflects the computational overhead of maintaining aggregation state across streaming data.

## Streaming SQL Features

### EMIT Modes Support

- **EMIT CHANGES**: Continuous emission of results as data arrives
- **EMIT FINAL**: Emission of final results when window boundaries are reached
- **Validation**: EMIT FINAL correctly validates windowed vs non-windowed queries

### Window Support

- **TUMBLING**: Fixed-size non-overlapping time windows
- **SLIDING**: Overlapping time windows with configurable advance interval
- **Performance**: Window operations maintain high throughput while providing temporal boundaries

### Dual-Mode GROUP BY Implementation

The system supports two distinct GROUP BY modes for different streaming use cases:

#### 1. **Windowed Mode (Default)**
- **Use Case**: Batch processing, periodic reports, time-series analysis
- **Behavior**: Accumulates data within windows, emits results when windows close
- **Performance**: More efficient for high-throughput scenarios
- **Throughput**: 5,000-12,000 msgs/sec depending on aggregation complexity

#### 2. **Continuous Mode (CDC-style)**  
- **Use Case**: Real-time dashboards, live counters, change data capture
- **Behavior**: Emits updated result for affected group with every input record  
- **Performance**: Higher overhead but provides immediate updates

## Benchmark Methodology

- All benchmarks run against in-memory data structures
- Results represent sustained processing rates
- Each test processes real streaming records with realistic data patterns
- Performance measurements exclude I/O overhead (Kafka, disk, network)
- Benchmark focuses on core SQL execution engine performance

## Notes

- GROUP BY operations show lower throughput due to state management overhead
- Window functions perform well due to optimized streaming implementations  
- Some advanced SQL features (certain window aggregations) are still in development
- Performance results are specific to this test environment and may vary in production

## Legacy vs New Processor Architecture Comparison

### Architectural Overview

FerrisStreams underwent a major architectural transformation from a monolithic execution engine to a modular processor-based system. This section compares the two approaches:

#### Legacy Architecture (Pre-Phase 5)
- **Structure**: Single monolithic `engine.rs` file (7,077 lines)
- **Processing**: All query types handled in one massive execution method
- **State Management**: Centralized state in the main engine
- **Code Organization**: All logic mixed together (expression evaluation, aggregation, windowing, etc.)
- **API Surface**: Over-exposed internal types and methods

#### New Processor Architecture (Post-Phase 6)
- **Structure**: Modular processor system with specialized components
- **Processing**: Query-specific processors handle different SQL operations
- **State Management**: Distributed state with proper encapsulation
- **Code Organization**: Clean separation of concerns across modules
- **API Surface**: Clean public API with internal implementation details hidden

### Architectural Components Comparison

| Component | Legacy Model | New Processor Model |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Expression Evaluation** | Mixed in engine.rs (1,500+ lines) | `expression/` module (4 files) |
| **Aggregation Logic** | Mixed in engine.rs (500+ lines) | `aggregation/` module (4 files) |
| **Query Processing** | Single monolithic method | `processors/` module (5 files) |
| **Type System** | Mixed with logic | `types.rs` (dedicated file) |
| **Internal State** | Public API exposure | `internal.rs` (properly encapsulated) |

### Performance Analysis: Legacy vs Processor

Based on benchmark results, the new processor architecture shows:

#### ✅ **Equivalent Performance** 
- **SELECT Operations**: Both architectures achieve ~80,000+ msgs/sec
- **GROUP BY Operations**: Both maintain 5,000-12,000 msgs/sec throughput
- **Window Functions**: Both achieve 65,000-75,000 msgs/sec

#### ✅ **Architectural Benefits**
1. **Maintainability**: Modular design makes code easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Component isolation enables focused testing
3. **Extensibility**: New SQL features can be added as new processors
4. **API Clarity**: Clean separation between public and internal interfaces

#### ⚠️ **Migration Complexity**
- **Phase Duration**: 6 major phases to complete the transition
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 98-100% test success throughout migration
- **Risk Management**: Incremental approach with dual-path routing during transition

### Processing Path Routing

The system uses intelligent routing to determine execution path:

```rust
fn should_use_processors(query: &StreamingQuery) -> bool {
    match query {
        StreamingQuery::Select { .. } => true,          // ✅ Processors
        StreamingQuery::CreateStream { .. } => true,    // ✅ Processors  
        StreamingQuery::CreateTable { .. } => true,     // ✅ Processors
        StreamingQuery::Show { .. } => true,            // ✅ Processors
        _ => false,  // Other query types use legacy
    }
}
```
