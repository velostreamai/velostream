## Priority 1: Critical - Window Frame Execution Implementation

### Issue
Window frame specifications (ROWS BETWEEN, RANGE BETWEEN) are parsed correctly but **NOT applied during query execution**. Tests in `window_frame_execution_test.rs` are detecting real bugs in aggregation calculations.

### Root Cause Analysis
**File**: `src/velostream/sql/execution/expression/window_functions.rs` (lines 281-353)
- `calculate_frame_bounds()` function exists but is **NEVER CALLED**
- Window frame specification is parsed but discarded during execution

**File**: `src/velostream/sql/execution/aggregation/accumulator.rs`
- `process_record_into_accumulator()` includes **ALL records** in aggregation
- No filtering by window frame bounds (start_offset, end_offset)
- Rebuild aggregations for each row position considering only frame-filtered records

### Test Evidence
**Test File**: `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/window_frame_execution_test.rs`
**Test Count**: 9 async functions with value assertions

**Example Failure**:
```
Test: test_rows_between_unbounded_preceding_execution
Row 2 calculation:
  Expected: AVG(10.0, 20.0) = 15.0  (rows 1-2 in UNBOUNDED PRECEDING frame)
  Actual: 20.0 (only current row or miscalculated)
  Status: FAILS ‚ùå
```

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Integrate Frame Bounds into Aggregation Pipeline
- [ ] **File**: `src/velostream/sql/execution/aggregation/accumulator.rs`
- [ ] **Function**: `process_record_into_accumulator()`
- [ ] **Change**: Before aggregating a record, calculate frame bounds using `calculate_frame_bounds()`
- [ ] **Complexity**: Medium
- [ ] **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

#### Task 1.2: Handle Frame Boundary Edge Cases
- [ ] **File**: `src/velostream/sql/execution/aggregation/accumulator.rs`
- [ ] **Cases**:
  - UNBOUNDED PRECEDING: include all rows from start to current
  - CURRENT ROW: only current row
  - UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: include current row to end
  - PRECEDING(n): last n rows before current
  - FOLLOWING(n): next n rows after current
- [ ] **Complexity**: Medium-High
- [ ] **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

#### Task 1.3: Verify Against Test Suite
- [ ] **Test File**: `window_frame_execution_test.rs` (9 tests)
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: All 9 tests pass with correct value assertions
- [ ] **Complexity**: Low (tests already exist)
- [ ] **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (will iterate with implementation)

**Total Priority 1 Effort**: ~8-12 hours

## Priority 0: CRITICAL - Add Value Assertions to 194 Parsing-Only Tests

### Issue Discovery
Comprehensive test audit reveals **61% of SQL tests (194/318) only validate SQL parsing, NOT computed values**. This is a systematic test quality issue across the entire codebase.

### Test Quality Breakdown
- **194 tests (61%)** - Parsing-only (HIGH RISK)
- **124 tests (39%)** - Have value assertions (GOOD)
- **83 tests (26%)** - ZERO assertions whatsoever

### Critical Test Files (83 parsing-only tests)

**Tier 1 - Most Critical (8 files, 83 tests)**:
1. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/window_edge_cases_test.rs` (15 tests)
2. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/statistical_functions_test.rs` (12 tests)
3. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/complex_having_clauses_test.rs` (6 tests)
4. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/emit_changes_late_data_semantics_test.rs` (8 tests)
5. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/window_frame_execution_test.rs` (9 tests)
6. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/session_window_functions_test.rs` (8 tests)
7. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/fr079_phase1_detection_test.rs` (22 tests)
8. `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/timebased_joins_test.rs` (3 tests)

**Tier 2 - Mixed Quality (3 files, 43 tests with 50-79% assertions)**:
- `fr079_aggregate_expressions_test.rs` (77% parsing-only)
- `window_gaps_test.rs` (67% parsing-only)
- `emit_changes_advanced_test.rs` (56% parsing-only)

### Reference Models (Best Practices)
These files show excellent value assertion patterns to copy from:
- `tests/unit/sql/execution/aggregation/functions_test.rs` (100% assertions)
- `tests/unit/sql/execution/aggregation/group_by_test.rs` (90% assertions)
- `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/emit_changes_basic_test.rs` (100% assertions)

### Pattern: Before vs After

**‚ùå BEFORE (Parsing-Only - Insufficient)**:
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_window_aggregation() {
    let results = SqlExecutor::execute_query(sql, records).await;
    WindowTestAssertions::print_results(&results, "Debug output");
    // ‚ùå No actual assertions! Bug could be hiding here.
}
```

**‚úÖ AFTER (With Value Assertions - Comprehensive)**:
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_window_aggregation() {
    let results = SqlExecutor::execute_query(sql, records).await;
    assert!(!results.is_empty(), "Should produce results");

    if let Some(record) = results.first() {
        // ‚úÖ Validate actual computed values
        assert_eq!(
            record.fields.get("sum_amount"),
            Some(&FieldValue::Float(150.0)),
            "SUM should be 150.0 for window [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]"
        );
        assert_eq!(
            record.fields.get("count_rows"),
            Some(&FieldValue::Integer(3)),
            "COUNT should be 3"
        );
    }
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 - High-Risk Tests (Tier 1, 83 tests)**:
- Add 2-3 value assertions per test
- Focus on: window boundaries, aggregation results, watermark behavior
- Estimated effort: 2-4 weeks
- Expected result: +26 percentage points (39% ‚Üí 65% coverage)

**Phase 2 - Medium-Risk Tests (Tier 2, 43 tests)**:
- Add additional assertions to partially-tested functions
- Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks
- Expected result: +14 percentage points (65% ‚Üí 79% coverage)

**Phase 3 - Remaining Tests (remaining test files)**:
- Systematic audit and enhancement
- Estimated effort: 1 week
- Expected result: +6 percentage points (79% ‚Üí 85% coverage)

### Business Impact

**Current Risk: HIGH**
- Bugs in aggregation logic undetected
- Window semantics not validated at all
- Watermark behavior not verified
- Statistical functions not mathematically checked
- Edge cases silently fail

**After Implementation: LOW**
- All computational bugs caught immediately
- Complete semantic validation
- Regression detection enabled
- Edge cases properly verified

### Success Criteria
- Phase 1: All 83 Tier 1 tests have at least 2 value assertions
- Phase 2: All 43 Tier 2 tests have ‚â•80% assertion coverage
- Overall: Achieve 85%+ value assertion coverage across all SQL tests

---

## Testing & Validation

### Window Frame Tests
**File**: `tests/unit/sql/execution/processors/window/window_frame_execution_test.rs`
- 9 test functions with explicit expected values
- Value assertions validate actual aggregation calculations

### Parser Validation
**Files**: 5 demo/example SQL files requiring parser fixes

Run after parser implementation:
```bash
cargo build --examples --no-default-features
cargo run --bin velo-cli validate examples/ecommerce_analytics.sql
```

## SQL Parser Gaps - Detailed Analysis

### Gap 1: CREATE STREAM...WITH Configuration (3 files, 72% demo compatibility)

**Files Affected**:
- `examples/ecommerce_analytics.sql`
- `examples/iot_monitoring.sql`
- `examples/social_media_analytics.sql`

**Error**: `Expected As, found With`

**Current Issue**:
```sql
-- Currently FAILS
CREATE STREAM orders WITH (
    config_file = 'examples/configs/orders_topic.config',
    format = 'json',
    compression = 'gzip'
);
```

**Parser Currently Accepts**:
```sql
CREATE STREAM orders AS
SELECT * FROM kafka_source;
```

**Solution**: Implement full `CREATE STREAM ... WITH (property = value, ...) ...` syntax support

**Impact**: Medium - blocks configuration-driven stream definitions

---

### Gap 2: WITH Clause Property Configuration (1 file)

**Files Affected**:
- `examples/file_processing_sql_demo.sql`

**Error**: `Expected String, found Identifier`

**Current Issue**:
```sql
WITH (
    format = 'jsonlines',
    compression = 'gzip',
    batch_size = 1000
)
```

**Solution**: Enhance parser for property-style WITH clauses with contextual parsing

**Impact**: Medium - affects configuration blocks in various contexts

---

### Gap 3: Special Character Handling - Colon (1 file)

**Files Affected**:
- `examples/iot_monitoring_with_metrics.sql`

**Error**: `Unexpected character ':' at position 10247`

**Likely Causes**:
- YAML-style configuration blocks (key: value)
- URL specifications (http://...)
- Type annotations or namespacing
- Time specifications (12:34:56)

**Solution**: Debug exact context and implement targeted colon support

**Impact**: Low-Medium - context-specific, requires investigation
